Former President Trump's criminal conviction in his historic New York trial may have thrown the 2024 presidential election into unprecedented upheaval – or it may not have, according to Dr. Allan Lichtman.    The American University historian, who has correctly predicted the outcome of nine of the last 10 U.S. presidential elections, told Fox News Digital that instant analysis of Trump's conviction is meaningless as the country looks forward to Election Day. \"We're not going to know much until the sentencing hearing on July 11, right before the Republican convention,\" Lichtman said in an interview. Allowing himself to speculate, the proven prognosticator said Trump's conviction on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records does not appear to have fundamentally cracked his base, which Trump will need united to defeat President Biden in November. But no one knows, neither Lichtman nor the pundits he perennially outperforms, how Americans outside Trump's base will react to a convicted criminal on the presidential ballot.  \"We don't know how this might affect moderate and swing independent voters. So really, we have got to look over time and not rely on instant, unreliable punditry,\" said Lichtman.   TRUMP GETS WARM RECEPTION AND PILES OF CAMPAIGN CASH DURING SUNNY BLUE STATE SWING  Lichtman does not believe that former President Trump's guilty verdict has tarnished the overall support of his base. (Eric Thayer for The Washington Post via Getty Images)  Lichtman is a historian, not a psychic. The formula he's used to correctly predict nearly every presidential race since 1984, his \"Keys to the White House,\" was developed in 1981 with mathematician Vladimir Keilis-Borok and is based on their analysis of presidential elections dating back to 1860. The secret to his success, Lichtman says, is to keep his own personal preferences out of his predictions.\"We reconceptualize presidential elections not as Carter versus Reagan, Republican versus Democrat, liberal versus conservative, but in geophysical terms,\" he explained. \"Stability: The White House party keeps power. Earthquake: The White House party is turned out.\"   The \"keys\" consist of 13 true or false questions, parameters that, if true, favor stability. When eight or more of the keys are false, the incumbent White House party is the predicted loser. This formula helped Lichtman correctly predict that Trump would prevail in 2016, when the polls, debate performances and political commentators all favored Democrat Hillary Clinton. Previously, he said President Barack Obama would win re-election when Republican Mitt Romney was favored. And he correctly called the 2020 election for Biden. \"The keys are an alternative to the polls, which are not predictors. They're snapshots, they're abused, not used as predictors. And the pundits, you know, who are a lot of fun, but they're sports talk radio. They have no scientific basis for any of their predictions,\" Lichtman argued.  TRUMP RILES UP FIERY SWING STATE CROWD IN FIRST RALLY SINCE NEW YORK CONVICTION  Lichtman believes he has the secret to predicting who will win the vote in any U.S. presidential election, and he has the record since 1984 to prove it. (Nicholas Kamm/AFP via Getty Images)    The 2024 election is still in flux, and so Lichtman has not made a final projection for this year. But a lot would have to go wrong for Biden to lose to Trump, he claims.Lichtman's keys are as follows: party mandate, contest, incumbency, third party, short-term economy, long-term economy, policy change, social unrest, scandal, foreign/military failure, foreign/military success, incumbent charisma and challenger charisma.As things stand, Biden has definitively lost two of Lichtman's keys. \"He's lost what I call the mandate key based on midterm elections, because the Democrats lost seats in 2022, they needed to win seats to win that key. And he loses the charisma key because he's no Franklin Roosevelt or John F. Kennedy,\" Lichtman said.    If six keys turn against Biden, he is likely to lose. The four keys to watch are whether Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., or another third-party candidate wins at least 10% support in national polls; social unrest linked to widespread anti-Israel protests on college campuses, and success or failure for Biden's foreign policy endeavors amid the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. POLLING GURU FLOATS THE IDEA OF BIDEN DROPPING OUT: AT SOME POINT ‘CONTINUING TO RUN IS A BIGGER RISK’  Lichtman says that Biden currently holds two of the \"keys\" – but notes that the rest appear to be in flux.  (Hannah Beier/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Several Democratic strategists and a number of pundits are losing confidence in Biden's campaign as polls show Trump ahead in several key swing states. Election data guru and FiveThirtyEight founder Nate Silver suggested Monday that the president's \"all-time low\" in approval ratings might be enough justification for him to drop out or for the party to nominate someone else at the Democratic convention in August.   Lichtman warns that replacing Biden would be a massive unforced error for Democrats.    \"With Biden running, he wins my incumbency key: sitting president. He wins the party contest: uncontested. Essentially, that means he wins two keys off the top,\" Lichtman explained. Without Biden on the ticket, the Democrats would automatically lose two more keys, meaning just four more would have to fall to predict their defeat.   JAMES CARVILLE REGRETS THAT BIDEN IS RUNNING, WORRIES YOUNGER GENERATION UNINTERESTED IN POLITICS  Without Biden on the Democratic ticket, the party would automatically lose two more keys. (AP Photo/Julia Nikhinson and Evan Vucci)\"This nonsense about Biden stepping down points to the dangers of off-the-top-of-the-head punditry and commentary that is not based on any scientific understanding of how elections work,\" Lichtman said.   Doom and gloom punditry is part of what Lichtman calls the \"political industrial complex\" – an iron triangle of pollsters and political consultants who profit from campaigns, news reporters eager to cover negative soundbites and politicians who are afraid to challenge the other two points of the triangle. The horse race theory of elections creates drama and makes money for those involved, Lichtman claims, but it's not very helpful to inform Americans about the direction of the country.   \"The keys provide a way of breaking the iron triangle,\" said Lichtman. \"The candidates themselves have to run different kinds of campaigns,\" he added. \"Campaign by the keys, which is, you campaign on your vision. If you're an incumbent, what it is you have done and what you expect to do. If you're a challenger, what's your clear vision for America?\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Nobody remembers conventional campaigns. The ones that make history, Lichtman argues, are the substantive campaigns that articulated a vision for the country – think Barry Goldwater in 1964, who lost in a landslide but defined conservative principles for generations to come. Or George McGovern, whose liberal principals have shaped the Democratic Party since he was defeated by Richard Nixon in 1972.     \"Ronald Reagan in 1980 very forthrightly put forth his views on tax cuts, deregulation, building the military, challenging the Soviet Union. And he won, he won big,\" Lichtman said. \"And that philosophy again influenced politicians, in his case both liberal and conservative, through our time.\" Fox News Digital's Aubrie Spady and Joe Schoffstall contributed to this report.

The document had been stored at a library in Hamburg, Germany, as no one believed the document was of any significance.\"The fragment is of extraordinary interest for research,\" Lajos Berkes, a professor and one of the researchers who decoded the document said in a press release. \"On the one hand, because we were able to date it to the 4th to 5th century, making it the earliest known copy. On the other hand, because we were able to gain new insights into the transmission of the text.\"  \"It was thought to be part of an everyday document, such as a private letter or a shopping list, because the handwriting seems so clumsy,\" he continued. \"We first noticed the word Jesus in the text.

Gavin Newsom was astride the national political stage as people wondered whether he would be running for president. Now, Newsom is nowhere to be found outside California. The reasons are simple and they include the failing state of California.    In 2023, Gavin Newsom positioned himself well among Democrats. Many thought he was running for president. He took the fight to Republicans on numerous issues such as the climate, abortion and the economy. Newsom was seen on national TV repeatedly and even positioned himself as the foil to Florida Gov.

They must answer the questions, they must propose solutions and they must be likable.Newsom accomplished none of those things. He was not likable. His own wife pulled him off the stage after Newsom agreed to extend the debate. Newsom proposed few solutions and chose to attack DeSantis more than answer questions.  Video  Since that debate, Newsom has all but disappeared from the national stage.Newsom’s Distraction from Biden’s Campaign Had to EndFor a period of time, it helped the Democrats that Newsom was taking the fight to Republicans. Newsom was good at attacking Republicans when he did not have to answer questions about his own record.    GAVIN NEWSOM CALLED 'DELUSIONAL' AFTER TOUTING CALIFORNIA AS NATIONAL MODEL ON FIGHTING HOMELESSNESS    However, once Biden made it clear he was not going to step aside, Newsom’s young virile forays against Republicans became a problem for Biden. It took the spotlight from Biden and fueled the calls for Biden to step aside. So, instead, Newsom stepped aside. VideoCalifornia is a Mess and Getting WorseOn that debate stage with DeSantis, Gavin Newsom boasted, as he usually does, about how great California is. The pictures and numbers say otherwise.Less than week after that debate, a CBS Sacramento affiliate ran this headline: \"What contributed to California's record $68 billion budget deficit?\" That deficit has gotten \"progressively\" worse since then and big spending cuts are required – never a calling card for Democrats running for president.    Of course, crime is out of control in California. Here are some headlines: CALIFORNIA'S NEWSOM ATTACKED FROM HIS LEFT IN TEACHERS UNION AD BLITZ: 'MONUMENTAL CRISIS' Video\"South American gangs armed with knives are running wild on Los Angeles highways targeting terrified jewelers in brazen daytime robberies – slashing tires, shattering windows and even planting trackers on their cars.\"  \"ABC News correspondent victim of car 'smash and grab' in Oakland, feels 'sad for the folks that do this' – Violent crime, robbery and vehicle theft in Oakland increased by over 20% in 2023.\"    Now Newsom is proposing reduced spending on public safety because of the deficit.Homelessness is also out of control. So too is the wasteful spending by Newsom on the problem.

In 2023, this story ran about California: \"Seven of California’s largest property insurers, State Farm, Allstate, Farmers, USAA, Travelers, Nationwide and Chubb recently decided to limit new homeowners policies in the Golden State, raising questions about the stability of the California home insurance.\"California’s Housing Crisis  Beyond the insurance problem, \"only 15% of Californians can afford a home.\" According to California’s Public Policy Institute, that problem \"has been decades in the making.\" That was their assessment in 2020. VideoFor the people that live in California, none of that is news. They live with those problems every day – or not. Hundreds of thousands of people have left California for greener pastures. Under Newsom’s watch, California lost a congressional seat due to population lost for the first time in its history.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP    Those are just some of the low lights of Newsom’s record. When Newsom put himself in the national spotlight, it might well have been the first time that many people focused on his record.  Altogether, those problems and Newsom’s bad debate performance, are the reasons Newsom has retreated from the national stage – for now.

Can Alzheimer’s disease be reversed?    Dr. Heather Sandison, a renowned expert in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia care, believes that reversal isn’t just possible — but that it’s already happening in multiple patients. In her new book \"Reversing Alzheimer's: The New Tool Kit to Improve Cognition and Protect Brain Health,\" which was published by HarperCollins on June 11, Sandison — who is based in California — offers a step-by-step guide to helping Alzheimer’s patients improve their overall brain health.  NEW ALZHEIMER’S TREATMENT ACCELERATES REMOVAL OF PLAQUE FROM THE BRAIN IN CLINICAL TRIALS  One of the core elements of Sandison’s program is a focus on exercise as one of the most important lifestyle factors in preventing and controlling dementia.   Research has shown that physical activity can reduce the likelihood and progression of Alzheimer’s.   Dr. Heather Sandison, at left, is a naturopathic doctor specializing in neurocognitive medicine and the founder of Solcere Health Clinic, San Diego’s premier brain optimization clinic, and Marama, the first residential memory care facility to have the goal of returning cognitively declined residents to independent living. (Dr. Heather Sandison/iStock)In the excerpt below, Sandison offers some specific recommendations for the types of exercise that can benefit patients living with the disease. Read an excerpt from ‘Reversing Alzheimer’s'  Dr. Heather Sandison: Need a new motivation to be active? Exercise is medicine for the brain and provides an amazing array of benefits. Most obviously, exercise increases blood flow throughout the body, including to the brain. That means getting your body moving will deliver more oxygen and nutrients to your brain while also flushing away more waste products.   Exercise also strengthens the heart and cardiovascular system, which helps improve blood flow even when you’re not working out; it also reduces the risk of arterial plaques that might disrupt blood flow to the brain and contribute to dementia.    ALL ABOUT ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE: SIGNS, SYMPTOMS AND STAGESThe overarching reason that exercise is such a powerful health protector is that it is what’s known as a hormetic, or a beneficial stressor. Basically, when you put your body through its paces, the body is forced to use up resources, and your tissues can even be broken down a bit. (That’s what happens when you lift weights: Your muscles tear a tiny bit.)   Dr. Heather Sandison, an expert in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia care, believes that reversal isn’t just possible but that it’s already happening in multiple patients.  (Dr. Heather Sandison)    In that sense, you’re introducing stress to your system, but that stress is a force for good, because it triggers your body to get more efficient at using its resources and your tissues to grow back even stronger. In other words, exercise makes your body — including your brain — more resilient.Exercise benefits several of the root causes of neurological disease.It improves structure by increasing your cardiovascular capacity and boosting circulation, which delivers oxygen and nutrients to the brain.  FOR ALZHEIMER’S PATIENTS, EATING POMEGRANATES COULD HELP ALLEVIATE SYMPTOMS, STUDY SAYS: ‘PROMISING RESULTS’    It reduces stress in multiple ways — by giving you an outlet to blow off steam, by producing feel-good hormones such as endorphins and lowering the stress hormone cortisol, and, depending on what kind of exercise you choose, getting you outside and into nature, which is a well-known stress reliever. It can also be social, and a great way to spend time with friends or even meet new people, which helps address the loneliness and social isolation that The Lancet lists as one of the modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease.  In her new book \"Reversing Alzheimer's: The New Tool Kit to Improve Cognition and Protect Brain Health,\" published by HarperCollins on June 11, Sandison — based in California — offers a step-by-step guide to helping Alzheimer’s patients improve their overall brain health. (HarperCollins)  It improves sleep by tiring you out.It strengthens immune function, which reduces the risk and effects of infection — all those muscular contractions and moving against gravity improves the flow of lymphatic fluid, which delivers immune cells and flushes away invader cells.\"Exercise benefits several of the root causes of neurological disease.\"   It promotes detox, both through increased circulation and through sweating.   It improves signaling, as challenging and strengthening your muscles triggers the release of multiple signaling molecules, known as exerkines, that have demonstrated neuroprotective functions.  \"The overarching reason that exercise is such a powerful health protector is that it is what’s known as a hormetic, or a beneficial stressor,\" Sandison writes in her new book. (Dr. Heather Sandison)If you do only one thing: Change up your current exercise routine in a way that challenges your brain and amps up the intensity.   If you are a devoted walker, find a new route that includes hills or stairs. If you’re open to trying something different, check out a new exercise class that you’ve been meaning to try.              Categories of exercise: some familiar, some cutting-edge    There are four types of exercise that you want to prioritize. Four may sound like a lot, but they are not mutually exclusive. You can combine at least two types of exercise in one session — you can turn strength training into cardio by performing your strength moves in high-intensity intervals, or you can make your cardio dual task by doing something that requires your mental focus while you move.Aerobic exerciseAerobic exercise is what we think of as \"cardio\" — it gets your heart and blood pumping and includes forms of exercise such as walking, jogging, biking, dancing and swimming.  Aerobic exercise strengthens your heart, and what’s good for your heart is also good for your brain, because your heart sends the brain the blood, oxygen, and nutrients that your brain relies on to function.  EXPERIMENTAL ALZHEIMER’S DRUG GETS FDA ADVISORY PANEL'S THUMBS-UP: ‘PROGRESS IS HAPPENING’Your first goal with adding more exercise to your life is to get 150 to 200 minutes of aerobic exercise each week so that you get your heart rate into the vigorous zone of 70-85% of maximum heart rate.     Listening to your body and adjusting your intensity level based on your perceived exertion is one of the best ways to know if you are pushing yourself hard enough.Strength training    Strength training — also known as resistance training — is just what it sounds like: using weights or other forms of resistance to build muscle tissue.  Building muscle — particularly in the big muscle groups of the legs, hips, and torso — is directly related to brain health, because these muscles generate brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a \"fertilizer\" for the brain, cueing it to create new neuronal connections and promoting neuroplasticity.  Alzheimer's patients should aim for at least two strength-training sessions per week, notes the author of a new book.  (iStock)  You want to aim for at least two strength-training sessions per week. Strength training doesn’t have to involve your standard barbells and bench pressing your body weight. You can use resistance bands, light dumbbells, or even the weight of your own body in exercises like squats, lunges and planks. Even climbing stairs or hills counts as strength training and cardio in one activity, because they get your heart rate up as they also keep the muscles of the legs and hips strong.                    Dual-task training    This next-level form of exercise combines physical movement with a cognitive challenge. The simplest form of this is walking and talking.   What is a cognitive challenge will vary from person to person, but if you’re in prevention mode, listening to a foreign language lesson or a nonfiction book while you walk outside or ride the stationary bike, and then pausing the recording to recap what you’ve just learned every few minutes, is a good option. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER                                                                                                   For some people, going to a Pilates or yoga class or other class where you really have to pay attention to the teacher’s cues constitutes dual-task training — but not if it’s something you’ve been doing for long enough that you can zone out. \"Exercise is such a powerful health intervention that if we could just bottle it, we could probably get rid of chronic disease.\"   And if you have already started experiencing measurable cognitive decline, dual-task training may look like going on a walk while pointing out the names of the plants that you pass along the way, or having someone quiz you on the names of family members, or recalling family stories or important dates. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP             Wherever you are, you want to be working right on your edge — you can almost feel the wheels of your brain turning in order to stay focused.Contrast oxygen therapyThis relatively unique form of training alternates the amount of oxygen in the air you breathe as you exercise — an approach that encourages the tiniest blood vessels (known as your microvasculature) throughout your body, including your brain, to open up, resulting in greatly enhanced blood flow.     It’s similar to going to altitude to train and build your aerobic capacity, and it is incredibly valuable for cognitive function.           \"Exercise does take time and effort, but making this one activity a regular part of your life addresses so many causal factors of dementia that it can profoundly reduce your risk,\" Sandison says in her book. (iStock)  This type of exercise does require specialized gear. You can buy the device, or go find a clinic near you where you can try it out. It does require you to wear a mask that is hooked up to a machine while you exercise, and when the oxygen saturation is low, it can be intense because you have to work harder to bring in enough air. In other words, contrast oxygen therapy is not for everyone. But if you are willing and able, it can be dramatically helpful.For more Health articles, visit www.foxnews/health     Honestly, exercise is such a powerful health intervention that if we could just bottle it, we could probably get rid of chronic disease. Exercise does take time and effort, but making this one activity a regular part of your life addresses so many causal factors of dementia that it can profoundly reduce your risk.Excerpted with permission from the new book, \"Reversing Alzheimer's: The New Tool Kit to Improve Cognition and Protect Brain Health\" (HarperCollins) by Dr. Heather Sandison, copyright © 2024 by Dr. Heather Sandison.

Ecuador is the safest bet to progress along with Chucky Lozano & Co., though Jamaica's improving team has been bolstered by a slew of English-born and based dual nationals from Premier League clubs, which will make them a tough out for eval one of its opponents.[Check out our 2024 Copa América preview]Group C: United States, Uruguay, Panama, Bolivia  The Americans have to like their draw even if it included Uruguay, perhaps the best South American team that wasn't included alongside them in Pot A. Led by rising Liverpool striker Darwin Núñez and coached by legendary Argentine manager Marcelo Bielsa, La Celeste is exactly the sort of foe the U.S. needs to test itself against in the lead-up to the 2026 World Cup — which will also be played on home soil. That they meet the Uruguayans in their last group stage — when either first place or a spot in the second round could be at stake — only adds to the importance of that contest.\"In a way, we're controlling our own destiny by putting them last,\" U.S. coach Gregg Berhalter told FOX Sports' Jenny Taft moments after Tuesday's draw was complete. \"If you take care of business in the first two games, which will be difficult games, you set up a winner-takes-all meeting.\"   In theory, handing Panama and Bolivia should be easier. But the Canaleros have upset the U.S. on several occasions over the years, including at multiple CONCACAF Gold Cups. And while Bolivia may be one of South America's weaker teams, a team used to facing Argentina and Brazil in meaningful matches won't go quietly, either.Group D: Brazil, Colombia, Paraguay, Costa Rica/Honduras    Led by the likes of Vini Jr., Rodrygo and Gabriel Jesus, five-time World Cup champion Brazil is among the favorites to win the tournament outright. Colombia is among the best of the rest, and when you add a second more than capable mid-tier CONMEBOL team in Paraguay to the mix, this ends up being among the more difficult of the four groups.Costa Rica should advance to the main event over a rebuilding Honduras in the playoffs in March, though the Ticos are also in the midst of a transition to a new generation of national teamers themselves after finishing dead last in its group at last year's World Cup. But as Costa Rica showed in Qatar by beating a Japanese side that upset both Germany and Spain, they won't fear any foe — even the mighty Brazilians.Doug McIntyre is a soccer writer for FOX Sports.

Southgate has been in charge of the Three Lions since 2016 but told a German newspaper that there were no guarantees he would remain in the post after the end of the tournament.\"If we don't win, I probably won't be here anymore,\" Southgate told Bild. \"Then it might be my last chance. If we want to be a big team and I want to be a top coach, then you have to deliver in the big moments.\"  Southgate has been one of the most successful England coaches in history, but has narrowly failed to deliver a major trophy to join the nation's sole success, the 1966 World Cup.  His team suffered heartbreak in the final of this event at Wembley Stadium three years ago, surrendering a lead before losing to Italy on penalty kicks. Before that, the squad lost to Croatia in the 2018 World Cup semifinal, after leading with 20 minutes to go in regulation.  And at the 2022 World Cup, England was one of the best teams in the tournament but lost 2-1 to France in the quarterfinal, with captain Harry Kane uncharacteristically blasting a penalty over the bar.\"I think about half of the national coaches leave after the tournament, that's the nature of international football,\" Southgate added. I've been here for almost eight years now and we've come close. So, I know that you can't keep standing in front of the public and saying ‘please do a little more,' because at some point people will lose faith in your message.\"  Southgate has been strongly linked to a return to club soccer with Manchester United, whose current head coach Erik ten Hag is on shaky ground after a dismal season, made only slightly better by victory over Manchester City in the FA Cup,Southgate is close with Sir Dave Brailsford, the right-hand man of billionaire Sir Jim Radcliffe, who now owns a partial share of United and is hugely influential in regard to the club's future direction. Southgate has refused to be drawn on that particular link.  However, he refused to sign a new contract with England before this tournament and his current deal runs only until the end of the year. At 53, he has plenty of time and opportunities ahead of him, should he wish.    The next major tournament after this would be the World Cup in 2026, to be hosted in the United States, Mexico and Canada. Among the reasons why Southgate may wish to stay with England is the strong crop of talent the group is currently blessed with.Jude Bellingham was named La Liga player of the year after a superb debut season with Real Madrid, Phil Foden's dynamism is a huge threat, and England is regarded as the favorite to win the Euros, even with World Cup runner-up France in the mix.Martin Rogers is a columnist for FOX Sports.

Ronaldo or Messi; who is better? — has been a question that's become soccer's version of LeBron James or Michael Jordan for more than a decade, but the hypothetical battle has tilted significantly against the Portugal superstar over the past 18 months.Messi's victory with Argentina in the 2022 World Cup, in the minds of many, struck the decisive blow in the argument, perhaps cementing the Argentina legend in the position of top dog for this generation.  The interesting thing about this clash of extraordinary talents is that it's not just one for the fans. Ronaldo cares about it, so does Messi, although the latter does a better job of hiding the fact.  And it is a conversation that has become entwined with their former teammates for a variety of reasons.  For years, there was an unwritten rule that if a player had played club soccer with Ronaldo, they would state his name whenever quizzed about who was the modern-day GOAT. If they'd played with Messi, you get the idea, they'd plump for him.  Germany legend Toni Kroos admitted as much in 2018, telling reporters: \"We were not only teammates but also neighbors in the dressing room and neighbors in real life. Cristiano lived right by me.\"Seeing what a perfectionist he is was impressive. That is why it is forbidden for me to name Messi.\"  But then things began to shift. Ronaldo's reputation took a hit in 2022 when his second spell with Manchester United disintegrated into acrimony and poor performance, and ultimately ended with him announcing a move to Al-Nassr of the Saudi Pro League.    Weeks later, Messi finally lifted the Jules Rimet Trophy, scoring twice in an epic World Cup final against France and again in the penalty shootout.Game, set, match, undisputed GOAT?Perhaps so. When Kroos was quizzed at the end of that tournament, he had changed his tune.    \"Messi deserves it,\" Kroos told Magenta TV, when asked the inevitable question about all-time greatness. \"In terms of individual performances at championships, I've never seen a footballer play as consistently as this guy. \"You have to remember that he has never played for clubs that I find appealing. That proves I mean it.\"Then Wayne Rooney, who spent years alongside Ronaldo at United but was not necessarily the closest of friends with him, crossed the divide by also naming Messi.  \"I have the greatest respect for Cristiano and when people argue he is the greatest, I know where they are coming from and respect that opinion,\" Rooney wrote, in London's Times newspaper. \"But, for me, Messi is just different.\"    To be clear, the topic is still not universal.  There remain plenty of Ronaldo loyalists happy to make their voice heard, especially when he is criticized.Former colleagues including French striker Louis Saha and Polish goalkeeper Tomasz Kuszczak, have been swift to come to Ronaldo's defense, and it is hard to find a Real Madrid player who doesn't rave about his time there.  However, heading into the Euros — which begin on Thursday with Germany v. Scotland (3 p.m. ET on FOX) — there is also an ultra-harsh school of thought among pundits that Portugal is better off when Ronaldo is on the bench.Such beliefs surely stem more from what happened at the last World Cup than the Euros qualifying campaign, where Ronaldo was outstanding as Portugal became the only team to win each of its 10 qualification games.  Ronaldo and company begin their campaign against the Czech Republic on June 18, and will be favored to advance comfortably from Group F, which also features Turkey and Georgia.  FOX soccer expert Alexi Lalas believes Ronaldo's rivalry with Messi, who represents Argentina in the upcoming Copa América, still has some serious legs.Ronaldo's only title with Portugal was the 2016 Euros, but he was forced into a spectator role after coming off injured early in the final.  \"These great rivalries, like Borg-McEnroe, Magic-Bird, they are great duos that are not by design, they just evolve,\" Lalas told me.     \"Ronaldo and Messi push each other, they make each other better, and even in that grudging respect there is some resentment. They are so different, but they would admit they are better because of the prodding and pushing and pulling of wanting to be better than the other. \"And, when you step back and look at it, as soccer fans we are all the beneficiaries of that, too.\"Martin Rogers is a columnist for FOX Sports.

Nothing disrupts a cruise ship vacation like an outbreak of illness — but by taking proper preventative measures, you can help reduce the risk of seafaring sickness.    In the most recent report of cruise ship illness, approximately 25 passengers returning from a cruise started to feel sick with nausea toward the end of a flight last week.\"CDC is aware of a flight from Vancouver, British Columbia, which arrived at Houston’s George Bush Intercontinental Airport on Friday, May 31,\" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in an emailed statement shared with Fox News Digital about United Flight 1528.  CRUISE SHIP'S CONCERNING CONDITIONS EXPOSED AFTER VESSEL FAILS SURPRISE HEALTH INSPECTION  \"Public health officers from CDC’s Houston Port Health Station worked with EMS to evaluate ill passengers on board.\"  Among the 163 passengers on the airplane, 75 were on the same cruise, according to multiple reports.  Nothing disrupts a cruise ship vacation like an outbreak of illness — but taking certain preventative measures can help reduce the risk of seafaring sickness. (iStock)\"As a precautionary measure, the aircraft will be removed from service and go through a deep cleaning before returning to service,\" United Airlines told Fox News Digital in an emailed statement.    Most of the ill passengers reported mild gastrointestinal symptoms, the CDC noted, but none had a fever during the flight or upon physical exams.CONSIDERING A CRUISE? HIGH SEAS MAY BE THE RIGHT OPTION FOR BOTH FAMILY AND WALLET  \"No passengers met CDC criteria for further public health follow-up,\" the CDC stated. \"Passengers from the flight continued with their travel plans.\"    Neither the CDC nor United Airlines specified which cruise line was involved.  The most common illnesses on cruise ships are respiratory illnesses, gastrointestinal infections and other vaccine-preventable diseases, according to the CDC. (iStock)The sick passengers may have taken a cruise on Royal Caribbean International’s Radiance of the Seas, as it was the only ship docked in Vancouver on the day of the flight, according to Cruise Radio, an organization that provides the latest cruise news.The ship had a confirmed norovirus outbreak from April 8 to April 22, according to the CDC.Additional cruise ship outbreaks    The CDC has reported seven outbreaks on cruise ships this year — including the Celebrity Summit by Celebrity Cruises, which sailed from May 24 to May 31.Approximately 68 passengers and five crew members on that ship reported diarrhea and vomiting during the cruise.AIRLINE OUTRAGE: PASSENGER REPORTEDLY TELLS MOM IN FIRST CLASS SHE SHOULDN'T BE THERE WITH A CHILD  Nearly all seven of the outbreaks were linked to norovirus, which historically has caused outbreaks of stomach pains and diarrhea on cruise ships.    The CDC Vessel Sanitation Program generally posts outbreaks that are of \"public health significance.\" This typically includes voyages from the U.S. and foreign ports that are 3-21 days long with 100 or more passengers, with 3% or more of the passengers or crew reporting symptoms of gastrointestinal illness.Common illnesses on cruise ships  The most common illnesses on cruise ships are respiratory illnesses, gastrointestinal infections and other vaccine-preventable diseases, according to the CDC.Among the respiratory illnesses, some common culprits include colds, influenza and COVID-19.\"Ships have close living quarters and communal spaces, which allow bacteria and viruses to spread more easily.\"   Gastrointestinal illnesses are highly contagious, the CDC warned.  Those can be caused by various germs, including bacteria, viruses or parasites, with the norovirus particularly well-known for causing stomach illness on ships.Norovirus, often referred to as the stomach flu, usually causes symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and stomach pain within 12 to 48 hours of exposure.  NOROVIRUS SPREAD ON THE WASHINGTON PACIFIC CREST TRAIL — WHAT TO KNOW AND HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF    Some people may also experience headaches, body aches and fever.People generally get better within several days, but they can still spread the infection several days after they feel well, according to the CDC.Why are cruise ships susceptible to outbreaks?\"Ships have close living quarters and communal spaces, which allow bacteria and viruses to spread more easily,\" Jill Blumenthal, M.D., infectious disease specialist at UC San Diego Health, told Fox News Digital.  \"In addition, passengers are regularly joining [the cruise] at different stops, making it easier to introduce illness.\"  Norovirus, often called the stomach flu, usually causes symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and stomach pain within 12-48 hours of exposure. (iStock)  Cruises may bring passengers to locations that put them at increased risk of infectious diseases like malaria, yellow fever, dengue fever, Zika, chikungunya and Lyme disease due to exposure to mosquito or tick bites, the CDC warned. Travelers are also more susceptible to food-borne illnesses, which can easily be transmitted person-to-person on a cruise ship.    DRINKING ALCOHOL BEFORE SLEEPING ON A PLANE COULD BE DANGEROUS, STUDY SUGGESTS\"Food-handling practices and water systems aboard certain vessels may have the potential for transmission of foodborne and waterborne diseases,\" Blumenthal said.  \"Port visits can also expose travelers to local diseases, which they can bring back on board,\" the doctor warned.Passengers should consult a health care provider to discuss risks.   Approximately 12.5 million passengers traveled on cruises that began in North American ports in 2022, per the CDC. Tips to prevent sickness on a cruiseThe CDC recommends that people ask about COVID-19 testing or vaccination protocols before traveling — and to consider wearing a mask in crowded or poorly ventilated areas.Prior to taking a cruise, passengers should consult a health care provider to discuss risks, vaccinations and other prevention strategies, as well as any medications to help prevent illness, said Blumenthal.   People should always remember to wash their hands with soap and water after using the bathroom, eating or touching surfaces, experts advised. (iStock)    This is particularly important for those who have chronic health conditions or who are immunocompromised, elderly or pregnant, the doctor said.

Pew Research Center released its \"Cultural Issues and the 2024 Election\" report this month, asking 8,709 adults, including 7,166 registered voters, about a wide range of cultural issues including marriage, gender, race, immigration and gun rights.Trump supporters were three times more likely than Biden supporters to say society is better off if people prioritize marriage and having children, the survey found. While 59% of Trump supporters agreed with this statement, just 19% of President Biden's supporters said the same.  The survey also found sharp differences between voters on the nation's declining birth rate.  MAJORITY OF DEMOCRATS SAY PARENTS SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO OPT KIDS OUT OF LEARNING ABOUT LGBTQ ISSUES IN SCHOOLS  Marriage and family's importance to society differed among Biden and Trump supporters, according to a new Pew report of U.S. voters. (AP Photo/Julia Nikhinson and Evan Vucci)  U.S. births declined across all ethnic and racial groups in 2023, by about 76,000 from the previous year. It was the country's lowest single-year tally of births since 1979, according to The Associated Press.Both Trump and Biden supporters held mixed views on this trend, but Trump supporters were more than twice as likely (47%) than Biden voters (23%) to view this trend as bad for society. Half of Biden voters and about a third of Trump voters held neutral views on the downward birth rate.  Abortion was another issue where Americans had vastly different views.Nearly nine in 10 Biden supporters said abortion should be legal in all or most cases compared to less than four in 10 of Trump supporters who felt the same.

NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!\n","  We are all feeling the effects of stubborn and persistent inflation. When the current administration tells us inflation is coming down, we must remind ourselves that only means already high prices are going up slower. When a few large pizzas, some salads, and garlic knots cost you $100, you begin to realize just how expensive life is getting for Americans.      So, is there any chance that prices will ever come down? The one thing, good or bad, that could make that happen is the D word: Deflation.What Is Deflation?Deflation, characterized by a general decline in prices for goods and services, is a stark contrast to inflation. While inflation erodes purchasing power, deflation increases it. However, deflation can signal severe economic distress and widespread economic stagnation. Understanding how deflation can occur in the United States involves a combination of economic factors, policies and external influences.  Will prices ever come down? (istock)Key Drivers of Deflation… It’s Me, I’m The Problem?  Decreased Consumer Demand: When consumers and businesses expect prices to fall, they may delay purchases and investments. This reduced demand can lead to an oversupply of goods and services, forcing prices downward. As Taylor Swift says, \"It’s me, I’m the problem.\" Perhaps the answer is we, as Americans, need to be spending less than we do today.  BIDEN REPEATS FALSE CLAIM THAT INFLATION WAS AT 9% WHEN HE TOOK OFFICE AFTER BEING CALLED OUT LAST WEEK  Technological Advancements: Technological progress can enhance productivity and reduce production costs, so perhaps rapid AI growth could solve our inflation problem.Monetary Policy: Are the Fed’s current policies too tight? Should they be raising interest rates even though it’s not what Americans want right now? Tightening rates even further might be the solution in part to solving the inflation issue. Video  Debt Deflation: High levels of debt can lead to deflation if consumers and businesses focus on paying down debt rather than spending or investing. With all of this consumer debt – $1.1 trillion of credit card alone – it could actually help with deflation if it accelerates even faster although some families will suffer greatly.Global Economic Conditions: Deflationary pressures can also be imported through international trade. A global slowdown or recession can reduce demand for U.S. exports, while cheaper imports can lead to domestic price declines.  BIDEN DISMISSES LOW CONSUMER CONFIDENCE ON THE ECONOMY: 'WE'VE ALREADY TURNED IT AROUND'Historical Context    The Great Depression of the 1930s is a classic example of deflation in the United States. During this period, the country experienced severe deflation, with prices falling by nearly 30%. The deflationary spiral was driven by a combination of high debt levels, bank failures and a collapse in consumer confidence. More recently, Japan’s \"Lost Decade\" in the 1990s serves as a cautionary tale of how prolonged deflation can stifle economic growth.  VideoNone of this sounds good for America, but it may sober people into realizing that prices may remain exactly where they are for a long time, with no chance of coming down.Potential Pathways to DeflationPost-Pandemic Economic Shifts: The COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented government spending and monetary easing to support the economy. As these supports are withdrawn -- meaning the government stops spending money – the potential for reduced consumer and business spending could emerge, especially if confidence in economic recovery wanes.    CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONPolicy Missteps: If the Federal Reserve and other policymakers misjudge economic conditions and tighten monetary policy too aggressively, they could inadvertently trigger deflationary pressures. Conversely, a failure to address high levels of corporate and consumer debt could also contribute to a deflationary spiral. VideoGlobal Economic Weakness: Ongoing trade tensions, geopolitical instability, or another global financial crisis could reduce demand for U.S. exports, increasing deflationary risks. A strong dollar, while beneficial for imports, could exacerbate deflation by making U.S. exports less competitive.Be Careful What You Ask For, You Just Might Get It  Deflation, while seemingly beneficial because we all want lower prices, can lead to severe economic consequences. Inflation will be one of the top items at the polling booth this November. Businesses may reduce production, cut wages and lay off workers, leading to higher unemployment and further reductions in demand. Is that what we are asking for right now?    CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP VideoAre we ready for higher unemployment? Are we ready for higher interest rates? Are we ready to STOP spending money? Are we ready for the government to STOP printing money?

Despite playing a major part in back-to-back Super Bowl victories for the Kansas City Chiefs, retirement has been a word associated with Travis Kelce, as many speculate how many years the 34-year-old has left in the game.     Kelce has brought up retirement in the past, saying recently that he would be lying if the thought of leaving the game behind had not crossed his mind. The NFL is grueling, and the future Hall of Fame tight end has dedicated many years with blood, sweat and tears to the game he loves. Over time, it takes a toll. However, during a press conference on Tuesday, Kelce reassured reporters and everyone else listening that he has a lot left to give to this league.   CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  Tight end Travis Kelce, #87 of the Kansas City Chiefs, walks off the field after the first half during Super Bowl LVIII against the San Francisco 49ers at Allegiant Stadium on Feb. 11, 2024, in Las Vegas.

During the Chiefs’ Super Bowl run, when they defeated the San Francisco 49ers in Las Vegas to hoist the Lombardi Trophy yet again, Kelce had 355 yards on 32 catches with three touchdowns over Kansas City’s four playoff games.

For one, his \"New Heights\" podcast with his older brother, Jason, who just retired after this past season from the Philadelphia Eagles, is one of the most popular sports programs in the country. Additionally, Kelce is a widely known public figure, which skyrocketed even more recently due to his relationship with Taylor Swift.

Andrew Jackson Higgins was born and raised 1,000 miles from the ocean — yet he forever changed war fought from the sea.     He designed and manufactured the iconic World War II amphibious landing craft that delivered Allied troops onto hostile beachheads from North Africa to Iwo Jima and countless battle zones in between. His \"Higgins boats\" became an icon of American and military ingenuity 80 years ago this week when they proved essential to the success of the epic D-Day invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944.  ANNE FRANK'S SPIRITS SOARED ON D-DAY: ‘FRIENDS ARE ON THE WAY,' SHE WROTE OF HEROIC GIS  Higgins \"is the man who won the war for us,\" Dwight D. Eisenhower said in a 1964 interview with historian Stephen Ambrose.  That was astonishing praise from the highest authority. Before becoming president, Ike was the supreme commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force in Europe. He planned and executed the D-Day invasion — the largest, most ambitious, most successful amphibious attack in the history of warfare.   Andrew Higgins while celebrating his company's production of its 10,000th boat in July 1944. His company produced the famous amphibious landing craft, dubbed Higgins Boats, that allowed Allied troops to insert with force into hostile territory around the globe during World War II.  (National World War II Museum)The Allies landed 160,000 men on the shores of France in the first 24 hours alone – many of them, if not most of them, sent into the breach from one of Higgins’ innovative steel-and-wood landing craft.  Higgins was a pugnacious Irish-American boatbuilder. Born in Nebraska, he rose to fame as a titan of wartime industry in New Orleans. \"Higgins is the man who won the war for us.\" \"With his wavy brown hair, square jaw and broad shoulders, Higgins looked like he could take care of himself in a fight,\" Paul Martin wrote in the 2012 book, \"Secret Heroes: Everyday Americans Who Shaped Our World.\"  Commonly called Higgins Boats, his landing craft were officially known in military parlance as LCVPs (land craft, vehicle, personnel).   American assault troops in a landing craft near a beachhead in northern France. The landing was supported by naval gunfire.  (MPI/Getty Images)    They were built to quickly unload men and equipment in shallow surf hazarded by underwater obstacles, then quickly reverse and return to the mother ship for more. He developed a larger version of the Higgins Boat called LCMs (landing craft, mechanized), sturdy enough to deliver troops with a battle tank from ship to shore. D-DAY BATTLE SITES EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD SEE AS EPIC INVASION FASCINATION DRAWS MILLIONS TO NORMANDY    The Army soldiers who fought their way up the spine of Italy to take it back from the fascists, the Rangers who scaled the cliffs of Pointe du Hoc on D-Day and the Marines who famously raised the flag over Iwo Jima all arrived into battle aboard Higgins Boats.Gen.

Richard Sutherland (center) step off a Higgins Boat landing craft and wade through knee-deep water in October 1944, to reach Philippine soil for the first time since MacArthur was ordered from the Philippines to Australia in March 1942. (Getty Images)  The grim but effective utility of the Higgins Boat was popularized among a new generation of Americans in the horrific opening scene of the 1998 Tom Hanks war epic, \"Saving Private Ryan.\"\"If it wasn’t for Andrew Higgins, the world could have gone a whole different way.\"      \"If it wasn’t for Andrew Higgins, the world could have gone a whole different way,\" said Fred Hoppe, a Nebraska artist who shares the same hometown as the boatbuilder. \"It could have been tyranny for the world instead of victory for us.\"   Hoppe is celebrated for his sculptures that pay homage to American war heroes around the world, including two dedicated to Higgins: one in Nebraska and one at Utah Beach in Normandy.MEET THE AMERICAN WHO EARNED THE MEDAL OF HONOR AND WAS MIA IN KOREA FOR 73 YEARS, CPL.

Dated 1944. (Photo 12/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)His dad, originally from Chicago, was a prominent judge, lawyer and newspaper publisher, connected at the highest levels of American politics.   \"Higgins was a close friend of Grover Cleveland and an enthusiastic Democrat,\" Jerry Strahan wrote in his 1998 biography of the boatmaker, \"Andrew Jackson Higgins and the Boats that Won World War II.\"    Strahan added, \"So enthusiastic that he named his new son after the party’s twice successful presidential candidate Andrew Jackson.\"MEET THE AMERICAN WHO LED 77 MINUTEMEN AGAINST 700 REDCOATS AT BATTLE OF LEXINGTON: CAPTAIN JOHN PARKERJohn Higgins died after falling down a flight of stairs when Andrew was just 7 years old.

(Rutherford Gares via The National WWII Museum)  It's apparently a quirk of history that the man who built the boats that achieved their greatest fame for attacking Omaha Beach in France on D-Day in 1944 spent his youth in Omaha, Nebraska. The Missouri River proved the gateway to the deepest interior of the continent during the Lewis & Clark Expeditions. It was here along the shallow \"Big Muddy\" that Higgins drew the inspiration that would one day deliver American might across the deepest oceans.Higgins joined the state militia where, among other things, he got his first taste of amphibious warfare.      Higgins joined the state militia where, among other things, he got his first taste of amphibious warfare. \"The troops had to cross the Platte River by pontoon,\" writes Strahan.   \"The experience, coupled with a strong desire to read instilled in him by his mother, led Higgins to become a student of military history.\"   MEET THE AMERICAN WHO FIRST COMMANDED THE MARINES: REVOLUTIONARY WAR HERO SAMUEL NICHOLASBut \"money was scarce and times were hard,\" reports the website of the Andrew Jackson Higgins National Memorial in Nebraska. Higgins sought opportunity elsewhere.    He moved to Mobile, Alabama, in 1906 and found employment in the lumber industry. He opened his own business, Higgins Lumber and Export Co., in New Orleans n 1922.  June 6, 1944: American soldiers on a landing craft on their way to the Normandy beaches, during the invasion of Europe.   (Keystone/Getty Images)  He eventually hauled exotic woods from around the world on his own fleet of sailing ships, \"said to have been the largest under American registry at that time,\" according to the Naval History and Heritage Command. Higgins Lumber was forced out of business at the dawn of the Great Depression.   \"Nevertheless, the indefatigable Higgins, who laughed at adversity and whose vocabulary did not include the word ‘impossible,' kept his boatbuilding firm (established in 1930 as Higgins Industries),\" reports the Naval History and Heritage Command.\"The Eureka Boat featured a shallow draft, recessed propeller … and the remarkable ability to run up on land and reverse back into water.\"   Higgins found success selling an innovative type of shallow-water craft called the Eureka Boat to oilmen and trappers who worked the bayous and the delta around New Orleans. The Eureka Boat featured a shallow draft, recessed propeller, ideal for negotiating water filled with unseen obstacles below the surface, and the remarkable ability to run up on land and reverse back into water.  The military history enthusiast had unknowingly reinvented amphibious warfare. He solved a problem plaguing American military planners in the 1930s as they prepared for the global war ahead.Most ancient form of naval warfareAmphibious assault is \"the most ancient form of naval warfare,\" famed historian Samuel Eliot Morison wrote in his 1962 epic of the U.S. Navy in World War II, \"The Two-Ocean War.\"    The ancient Greeks, Phoenicians and Norsemen all \"distinguished themselves\" in the ability to launch an attack from sea to land, he added.   Canadian troops leaving their ship for shore aboard the type of amphibious assault rowboats often used to attack a beachhead before the Higgins Boat. (Mirrorpix via Getty Images)  This age-old art of war, however, \"became discredited in World War I and for years thereafter was neglected by all naval powers except Japan,\" Morison wrote. Faith in air power, and the famously deadly British military blunder at Gallipoli in 1915, appeared to make amphibious warfare obsolete.\"Amphibious assault is the most ancient form of naval warfare.\" \"Land-based aircraft and modern coast defense guns would slaughter any landing force before it reached the beach,\" Morison wrote of the wisdom of the day.     Amphibious invasions of the past reached the beach on standard shallow water boats, either rowed or motorized, that had barely evolved from the days that the Ancient Greeks attacked across the Mediterranean or that Washington crossed the Delaware in 1776.MEET THE AMERICAN WHO ROWED WASHINGTON ACROSS THE DELAWARE ON CHRISTMAS: SAILOR-SOLDIER JOHN GLOVERA World War I Marine Corps recruit ad shows jarheads attacking a land target by jumping out of rowboats no different from one they might have rowed across a lake.

(Buyenlarge/Getty Images)    American military planners of the 1930s bucked the conventional wisdom of the era.   The United States, they correctly assumed, would be forced to insert its forces violently onto hostile beaches across both the Atlantic and the Pacific in the coming two-ocean war. American military planners turned to Higgins and his Eureka boats. They needed a new, better and more powerful way to deliver men and equipment from ship to shore.   They turned to Higgins and his Eureka boats. The sturdy but nimble vessels could move in shallow water, they had propellors protected from underwater obstacles and, after powering the bow up on land, they could quickly back up and return to water. \"When tested in 1938 by the Navy and Marine Corps, Higgins' Eureka boat surpassed the performance of [a] Navy-design boat and was tested by the services during fleet landing exercises in February 1939,\" reports the Naval History and Heritage Command.

Military planners showed a picture to Higgins.   He described it to his chief engineer over the phone and ordered him to work on it immediately.\"Higgins Industries responded by shattering production records, turning out more than 20,000 boats – 12,500 of them LCVPs – by the end of the war.\" Higgins Industries successfully demonstrated the new boat with the dropdown bow less than a month later.  The LCVP, the Higgins Boat, was born. It could carry up to 36 troops with combat gear, a jeep with 12 men, or more than four tons of cargo, deliver all of it right to the beach, back up and return to the mother ship for more men or equipment.   U.S. Rangers from E Company, 5th Ranger Battalion, on board a landing craft assault vessel (LCA) in Weymouth harbour, Dorset, June 4, 1944.

The initial round of severe storms will fire across the Upper Midwest on Wednesday afternoon. The stronger storms could become supercells capable of large hail greater than 3 inches in diameter, damaging wind gusts up to 65 mph and a couple of tornadoes.Rounds of thunderstorms are expected Wednesday and then again Thursday across the Midwest ahead of a strong cold front sliding through the region.(FOX Weather) By early evening, low-level wind shear – the change in wind speed and direction with height – will intensify, which will increase the chance of a few tornadoes across northern Minnesota and Wisconsin. A wind-damage threat will also be possible. This includes the Duluth area. The FOX Forecast Center noted there have not been any tornadoes recorded in northeastern Minnesota in two years.  \"Notice we do have a Level 3 out of 5 threat for severe storms,\" FOX Weather Meteorologist Kendall Smith said. \"This is centered right over kind of northern Minnesota.\"More than a half-million people are impacted by this Level 3 risk, including in cities such as Duluth, Hibbing, Brainerd and Cloquet in Minnesota, in addition to Superior, Wisconsin.Wedneday's activity will be more scattered with the strongest storms capable of very large hail to 3 inches in diameter, damaging wind gusts to 65 mph and a couple of tornadoes.(FOX Weather) The severe weather threat should continue into the mid- to late evening as storms move eastward into the far western Great Lakes region.More severe storms to fire up ThursdaySevere storms will fire up again on Thursday from the central Plains to the Great Lakes ahead of a cold front sweeping through the region. Cities such as Chicago and Kansas City are in the greatest threat area.The National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center has issued a Level 2 out of 5 on the severe storm risk scale impacting nearly 16 million people in other major cities including Aurora, Illinois, and Overland Park, Kansas.\"Today's (Wednesday's) coverage is more sparse, tomorrow's (Thursday's) coverage more widespread, but coverage is more of a strong, damaging wind event,\" Smith said.Thursday will feature a line of storms that will develop directly along the cold front with cities such as Chicago and Kansas City in the greatest threat area.(FOX Weather) While severe storms could develop along a 1,000-mile stretch from eastern Colorado and Wyoming into Michigan, the greatest potential for severe storms appears to be from northeastern Kansas northeastward into southern Michigan, where the greatest atmospheric energy will develop. While supercells with large hail are possible, it appears clusters of storms and their associated damaging wind gusts will be the main threat.

Every man is a Berliner, forced to look upon a scar.\"ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, FEB. 6, 1911, PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN IS BORN IN ILLINOIS  Reagan went on, \"As long as this gate is closed, as long as this scar of a wall is permitted to stand, it is not the German question alone that remains open, but the question of freedom for all mankind.\"\"Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate. Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.\"     He added, \"Gen. Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization, come here to this gate.\"Said Reagan, \"Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate. Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall,\" as the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration has recounted.   President Ronald Reagan, making his famous challenge to Mikhail Gorbachev to \"tear down the Berlin Wall,\" on June 12, 1987.  (Getty Images)For nearly three decades, Berlin was divided not just by ideology — but by a concrete barrier that was a bleak symbol of the Cold War, stated National Geographic.    As the U.S. and the Soviet Union battled for supremacy in space, they were also locked in an equally intense competition on Earth in Europe. REAGAN LIBRARY SPOKESPERSON REMEMBERS SPECIAL FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN QUEEN ELIZABETH II AND FORMER PRESIDENT\"Cold War tensions ratcheted up even further in 1961, when the Soviet-backed government in East Germany began building the Berlin Wall,\" notes CBS News. The Berlin Wall was \"erected in haste and torn down in protest.\"   \"The Berlin Wall was designed to seal off East Berlin from the part of the city occupied by the three main Western powers (U.S., Great Britain and France), and to prevent mass illegal emigration to the West from the Soviet Bloc.\"    The Berlin Wall was \"erected in haste and torn down in protest; the Berlin Wall was almost 27 miles long and was protected with barbed wire, attack dogs and 55,000 landmines,\" says National Geographic.

That means no more Mike Joy (sad), Clint Bowyer and Kevin Harvick. Instead, get ready to welcome Rick Allen, Jeff Burton, Steve Letarte and Dale Earnhardt Jr. BACK into your living rooms for the next four months!Wait. That's not right. Hang on … let me try again:Instead, get ready to welcome Rick Allen, Jeff Burton, Steve Letarte and … that's it … BACK into your living rooms for the next four months!For the first time since 2017, NASCAR fans are bracing for a summer without Dale Jr. – a reality that smacked them straight in the face yesterday when NBC sent out their annual press release detailing this year's coverage:No Dale Earnhardt Jr. is a dumb loss for NASCAR fans Whoooooooooof. Just tough. Look, I'm sure everyone will come on here and call me a FOX homer, which is fair. I get it. They do sign my paychecks, after all. But I promise you I'm not. I think – like everyone else – that the FOX NASCAR production needs some work. Lord knows we saw some examples of that this spring. But the FOX booth? Come on. It's just so much better than NBC, and it ain't close. In fact, the only thing that made it close was Dale Earnhardt Jr. That's it. He joined NBC back in 2018, and it's been a masterclass ever since. Of course, his TV contract expired after last season, and for some ungodly reason, NBC let him walk. Just like that. I truly can't think of a dumber decision, unless TNT lets Charles Barkley walk here in a few months. That will rival it. But until then? I'm convinced that letting Dale Earnhardt Jr. walk out those doors – and straight into Amazon's arms (beginning next summer) – is just the dumbest thing maybe in the history of NASCAR. And that's a looooooooooooooong list. Anyway, sane fans aren't thrilled with the prospect of having no Dale Jr. this summer, and they really ain't thrilled with his replacement … which is nobody. NBC is just leaving Jeff Burton and Steve Letarte in the booth along with Rick Allen – who is set to leave after the Olympics – and hoping it works. PS: Jeff Burton the driver? Solid dude. Remember the old Cingular Wireless car? Electric. But Jeff Burton the commentator? Whoooooof.\n","Image 1 of 101  \n","          next\n","         06.12.24   Image 2 of 101 \n","          prev\n","         \n","          next\n","         06.11.24

It isn’t that this is the best pitching matchup of the day (that’s between Framber Valdez of the Astros and Logan Webb of the San Francisco Giants). I couldn’t pass this up because I think this is a good opportunity for us to take a plus money play in a game between the Angels and the Diamondbacks.I read the MLB Player Survey from the Athletic the other day and was a bit surprised about a couple of the answers. One of them still has Mike Trout listed as one of the top vote getters for a question about who the best player in baseball is. That was surprising because Trout hasn’t played a full season in, well, ever. But the most games he’s played in a season over the past four years is 119. Since 2017 his highest game total is 140 (keep in mind 2020 was a short season, and he did play 53 games). Still this year he was hitting just .220 with 10 homers and 14 RBIs in 29 games. While the homer number is great, the RBIs are terribly low and so is the average. The other standout question was that the Angels were one of the worst franchises in baseball according to players. While I think they are cursed or something, I was a bit surprised that players felt this way. The complaint was that they don’t spend money. I disagree, they spend money, the results just are terrible. In any case, tonight they take on the Diamondbacks without Trout and Anthony Rendon (voted as one of the most overrated players in the game, and a guy they spent a ton of money to get). Tonight’s starter is Jose Soriano. Soriano has put together a pretty nice campaign overall with a 3.64 ERA and a 1.21 WHIP. He also has been significantly better on the road than at home. In seven appearances, Soriano has a 2.35 road ERA compared with a 5.54 ERA at home. Diamondbacks hitters are only 1-for-5 against Soriano, with the one hit leaving the yard. The Diamondbacks don’t have the same attention as the Angels did in that survey, but they have a target on their back this season. That is certainly something they didn’t have last year. It is nice to be able to fly under the radar, but this year they haven’t enjoyed the same type of comfort. They are one of many teams that are just a few games under .500, and currently sit in fourth place within their division. Fourth place really isn’t that big of a deal because they are two games behind second place. The problem is there are so many teams with similar records, and the Dodgers aren’t going to be caught for the division this season unless they suffer injuries. Tonight, they put Slade Cecconi on the hill. His ERA (5.66) is a bit ugly, but he does have a strong 1.14 WHIP. Looking a bit deeper into it, you see that he has allowed 10 homers in 41.1 innings. That’s where the ERA is coming from. After starting the year with two quality starts, he hasn’t finished six innings since. He also has had three starts where he has allowed six earned runs. He’s never faced the Angels, but one thing to note is he has only made two home starts and has allowed 12 earned runs over 10 innings. There really isn’t much of a question about which team is the better team. The Diamondbacks aren’t playing great baseball, but it is still better than what the Angels are producing. The reality of this particular game is that the Angels have the better pitcher. Cecconi has shown no indication that he can be a reliable starter for the team, especially at home. Soriano has been very good on the road, and fairly strong overall. I’ll rely on the Angels to win via the moneyline through five at +114. I’ll also sprinkle the -0.5 at +145. For more sports betting information and plays, follow David on X/Twitter: @futureprez2024\n","A report from Pablo Torre suggested that the NBA blocked Miriam Adelson from becoming the primary owner of the Dallas Mavericks after she bought a majority stake in the team from Mark Cuban last year. OutKick reached out to the league about the report. NBA spokesman Mike Bass said in a statement: \"The report is categorically false.\"Torre's report noted that Adelson and her late husband are massive donors to Donald Trump.Torre then attributed this as the primary reason that the league did not want Adelson to have full control of the franchise, and instead, appointed her son-in-law, Patrick Dumont, as the team's governor and representative to the NBA Board of Governors. The NBA is denying a Pablo Torre report that the league didn't allow Miriam Adelson, a prominent donor to Donald Trump, to be the primary owner of the Dallas Mavericks. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images)\"Her political reputation was apparently so radioactive that the NBA and commissioner Adam Silver would not allow her to be the governor of the team… even though, of course, the league would happily take the money of the fifth-richest woman in America,\" Torre said. \"Miriam's son-in-law, Patrick Dumont, an executive at her casino company, was appointed governor of the Mavericks instead. And the reason why the ostensibly left-leaning NBA insisted on this is obvious… nobody donated more money to Donald Trump in 2020 than Miriam Adelson,\" he added. OutKick reached out to Pablo Torre following the NBA's denial, and he did not return a request for comment. However, Torre did post on X (formerly Twitter) to say that he stands by the reporting. OutKick also reached out to the Dallas Mavericks for comment on the report, but they did not respond to our request. The NBA denies the report that they blocked Donald Trump donor Miriam Adelson from being the Dallas Mavericks primary owner because of her political affiliation. There are several features of this report that are fascinating, but let me quickly address one in the report from Torre itself. He calls the NBA \"ostensibly left-leaning.\" Here's the definition of the word ostensibly: \"apparently or purportedly, but perhaps not actually.\"Is he suggesting that the NBA isn't a left-leaning organization? He might be right about that, but probably not for the reason he added the word \"ostensibly.\" The NBA really isn't \"left-leaning\" because the NBA is hardcore left-wing. There's no question about that. No league in American professional sports pushes left-wing talking points more than the NBA. Not just the league, either, but the media that covers it, too. The NBA is denying a Pablo Torre report that the league and Commissioner Adam Silver didn't allow Miriam Adelson, a prominent donor to Donald Trump, to be the primary owner of the Dallas Mavericks. (Adam Glanzman/Getty Images)It's odd that Torre would report that an organization blocked a right-wing billionaire from being the primary owner of a team while also suggesting they aren't to the political left. The other very interesting aspect here is that the league already has an owner who has a \"radioactive political reputation.\" His name is Joseph Tsai and he owns the Brooklyn Nets. Tsai, of course, has deep connections with the Chinese Communist Party. Many would consider that to be a problem, but apparently not the NBA. In fact, the NBA loves it. Tsai helps them get money from China, which is why the league condemned executive Daryl Morey for coming out against the CCP back in 2019. The Nets, led by Tsai, even kept Morey from getting a suite at a Brooklyn home game because of those comments. Not only does Tsai own the Nets, but he also owns the New York Liberty, a team in the WNBA. It would be quite hypocritical of the league to block a right-wing owner while allowing a left-wing owner to speak as openly as Tsai does, but the league denies that's the case.\n","I'm going for the \"North American trifecta\" on the PGA TOUR this week, which I totally made up. But, my only two outright wins on TOUR this season are Jake Knapp at the Mexico Open in February and Robert MacIntyre at the RBC Canadian Open two weeks ago. Winning the 2024 U.S. Open this week at the Pinehurst Resort & Country Club's No. 2 course completes my trifecta. LISTEN: OutKick Bets Podcast's 2024 US Open Betting Powwow Ft Geoff Fienberg from the Mayo Media NetworkPinehurst is a Donald Ross design, restored by Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw in 2010. They replaced acres of turf with wire grass and sandy areas. The No. 2 course is a Par-70, playing at 7,588 yards with small Bermuda grass greens. Three U.S. Opens have been played here: 1999, 2005, and 2015. This course is a mind f---. Only three golfers shot under par here in the 2015 U.S. Open. Crenshaw called it \"a thinking man’s test\". World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler enters the 2024 U.S. Open as a 3-to-1 favorite to win his second major of the season after collecting his second green jacket in April. This is the shortest odds for any golfer since Tiger Woods in the 2013 PGA Championship. Speaking of which, Tiger is playing in the 2024 U.S. Open and Woods has +30000 odds. Second on the odds board is the 2024 PGA champion, Xander Schauffele, who is +1000. Last week, I got Scottie'd for a second time this year at the Memorial Tournament. Scheffler won his fifth tournament in 2024, beating my guy Collin Morikawa, who I had an outright bet on for the Memorial, by one stroke at Muirfield Village. Because I had a top-five bet on Scheffler and two other finishing position cashes, I was only -1.56 units (u) at the Memorial. For the season, I'm -40.42u. 2024 U.S. Open Betting Card Stats courtesy of Bet The Number from the Tour Junkies, Pay Mayo's Fantasy National, and the PGA Tour. ‘Starting 5’ The odds chosen are the best available at legal U.S. sportsbooks as of 4 p.m. ET Tuesday, June 11th.Collin Morikawa (+1600)The two-time major winner (2020 PGA Championship and 2021 Champion Golfer of the Year) is on a heater entering the 2024 U.S. Open. Morikawa has finished ninth or better in five of his last six starts, not counting the Zurich Classic, a team event. This includes a T3 at The Masters, ninth at the RBC Heritage, T4 at the PGA Championship, and second at the Memorial. Collin is contending in tournaments while being mediocre with his irons and he's one of the best golfers with his irons. Morikawa is doing this because he's second in driving accuracy on TOUR this year and 10th in Strokes Gained (SG): Around-the-Green (ARG), the two most important skills for winning at Pinehurst. Collin Morikawa after nearly hitting a birdie chip on the 18th green during the Round 4 the 2024 Memorial Tournament at Muirfield Village Golf Club in Ohio. (Kyle Robertson-USA TODAY Sports)However, his iron play is coming around and Collin has picked up strokes on approach (APP) in three straight starts. Finally, Morikawa is close to winning again and generally plays well in majors. Collin was T14 at last year's U.S. Open, T5 two years ago, and T4 in 2021. BET 1.4 units (u) on Collin Morikawa (+1400) at FanDuel to profit 22.5u. _____________________________Hideki Matsuyama (+4500)Until his odds drop to 25-to-1 or shorter, I'll always have money on 'Deki at a major. Matsuyama is a wizard ARG and from the bunker. He leads the PGA TOUR in SG: ARG this season and ranks 19th in sand save rate. Hideki is one of the best on TOUR at recovering from bad shots; he is sixth in Scrambling. Hideki Matsuyama plays a shot from a bunker in a practice round prior to the 2024 U.S. Open at Pinehurst Resort in North Carolina. (Jared C. Tilton/Getty Images)Also, Matsuyama plays better on tougher courses. He won the 2014 Memorial and the 2021 Masters. The U.S. Open is the hardest cut to make in golf and Hideki has only missed it once in his 10 U.S. Opens. The 32-year-old finished T10 in the 2013 U.S. Open, T2 in 2017, and fourth two years ago at Brookline. BET 0.5u on Hideki Matsuyama (+4500) at FanDuel to profit 22.5u. I'm also putting a 0.5u bet on Hideki Matsuyama Top-10 (+320) to profit 1.5u at BetMGM._____________________________Cameron Smith (+4500)While Pinehurst is in North Carolina, the sand-scape gives me desert vibes, and Smith is an Aussie familiar with the No. 2 course’s terrain. U.S. Opens are usually on courses that wouldn’t be a good setup for Smith. Yet, the 2022 Champion Golfer of the Year finished fourth at last year’s U.S. Open at Los Angeles Country Club's (LACC) North Course, which resembles Pinehurst. The \"generously wide fairways\" at the No. 2 course — again, not my words, Golfweek’s — help Smith because he’s inaccurate off-the-tee. Plus, he doesn’t have to worry about distance since the fairways will be firm and fast, and get a lot of rollout. Regardless, the elevated greens are Pinehurst’s best defense and Smith’s strength is his short-game.Finally, Smith just plays well on difficult courses. At Bet The Number, I pulled total SG data for several major-type courses, including Augusta National, TPC Sawgrass (host of THE PLAYERS Championship), and various PGA Championship and U.S. Open courses. Smith is fourth in total SG at those venues, per Bet The Number. BET 0.5u on Cameron Smith (+4500) at FanDuel to profit 22.5u. I'm also adding a 0.5u bet on Cameron Smith Top-10 (+320) to profit 1.5u at BetMGM._____________________________Sungjae Im (+8000) The South Korean is showing some form lately. Im has three T9s or better in three of his last four starts and a T12 at the RBC Heritage five starts ago. Including the RBC, three of those tournaments were \"signature events\" with the other two being the Wells Fargo Championship (T9) and last week's Memorial (T8).Also, Sungjae has average distance OTT, but he's been more accurate than the field in 13 of his 15 majors with shot-link data, according to DataGolf.com. As I've said many times, accuracy OTT is much more important than length at Pinehurst No. 2. Finally, per Bet The Number, Im is third in Sand Save rate, 16th in SG: ARG, and 20th in Scrambling, over the last 40 rounds. BET 0.28u on Sungjae Im (+8000) at FanDuel to profit 22.5u. I'm also putting a 0.25u bet on Sungjae Im Top-10 (+600) to profit 1.5u at BetMGM._____________________________Russell Henley (+9000) The four-time PGA TOUR champion is quietly having a great year. Henley is 10th in total SG. His biggest weakness is he doesn’t drive the ball far off-the-tee (OTT). But, Henley is seventh on TOUR this season in driving accuracy and Pinehurst is more about precision than length OTT. Furthermore, Henley has an underrated short-game; he is 19th in SG: ARG on TOUR this season. Russell has gained strokes ARG in 11 of his last 12 majors with shot-link data, according to DataGolf.com. Lastly, Henley leads the TOUR this year in Sand Save rate, and he's a Georgia native who putts well on these southern Bermuda grass greens. BET 0.25u on Russell Henley (+9000) at FanDuel to profit 22.5u. _____________________________Additional Finishing Position Bets Make placement bets at BetMGM, DraftKings, or FanDuel Sportsbooks. BetMGM doesn't apply \"dead heat\" rules ever. For the majors, DraftKings and FanDuel now have top-5, -10, and -20 bets that \"include ties\". Xander Schauffele Top-10 (+110): 1u to profit 1.1uBesides Scheffler, taking \"Schauffele to finish top-10\" is the best bet in the PGA TOUR this season. Xander got the \"monkey off of his back\" by winning his first major, the 2024 PGA Championship. Schauffele has 10 top-10 finishes in 14 events in 2024, including seven \"signature events\" and majors. More importantly, Xander plays well at U.S. Opens; he has six top-10s in seven career U.S. Opens. Tommy Fleetwood Top-20 (+138): 0.75u to profit 1.04u The Englishman's elite short-game makes him a perfect fit for Pinehurst No. 2. Fleetwood has gained strokes ARG in nine of his last 10 majors with shot-link data, according to DataGolf.com. Over the last 40 rounds, Fleetwood is eighth in both SG: ARG and Scrambling, per Bet The Number. He's finished in the top 20 in eight of his last 11 majors, including a T5 at the 2023 U.S. Open. Tommy Fleetwood hits a tee shot during a practice round for the U.S. Open at Pinehurst in North Carolina. (Jared C. Tilton/Getty Images)Sepp Straka Top-20 (+250): 0.5u to profit 1.25uThe Polish Georgia Bulldog has four top 10s on TOUR since mid-April: T5 at the RBC Heritage (\"signature event\"), T8 at the Wells Fargo (\"signature event\"), T5 at the Charles Schwab Challenge, and T5 at the Memorial (\"signature event\"). Sepp finished T12 at The Sentry (\"signature event\") and T16 at both THE PLAYERS and The Masters. Straka is second in driving accuracy on TOUR this year, the most important stat for the 2024 U.S. Open. Aaron Rai Top-20 (+450): 0.25u to profit 1.13u Since I prioritized accuracy and long irons for the 2024 U.S. Open, Rai is fifth in my Bet The Number model and fourth in my Fantasy National model. Now, I don't think Rai has that good of a chance of winning this week at Pinehurst. However, the Englishman is ninth on TOUR in driving accuracy this season and seventh in SG: APP. Par will be a good score at the U.S. Open and Rai is sixth in Bogey Avoidance this season. _____________________________U.S. Open 2024 One-And-Done Pick: Cameron SmithAfter 21 PGA TOUR events in the 2024 Mayo Cup, I'm 962nd of 4,400 entries with $10,483,877 collected. My one-and-done choice for the Memorial, Viktor Hovland, added only $329,000 to my season-long balance. Unfortunately, I'm running out of good players to use for one-and-done. Rory McIlroy, Xander, Morikawa, Hideki, and Scheffler have been used. Listen, anyone who isn't picking or has already used Scottie, myself included, is just looking for someone whose A-game can beat Scheffler if he plays his A- game. Smith is one of the 20 golfers I could see beating Scheffler at Pinehurst No. 2. The Aussie's touch ARG and putting are world-class. Smith is almost as good of a putter as Scottie is with his irons.Cameron Smith lines up a putt in the 2024 PGA Championship at Valhalla Golf Club in Kentucky. (Adam Cairns-USA TODAY Sports)Ultimately, he's the 2022 Champion Golfer of the Year and performs well in majors. I've heard many compare TPC Sawgrass (THE PLAYERS) and the Plantation course at Kapalua (host of The Sentry) to Pinehurst No. 2. Well, Smith won THE PLAYERS and The Sentry in his final season on TOUR in 2022. _____________________________Follow me on X (or Twitter, whatever) @Geoffery-Clark and check out my OutKick Bets Podcast for more betting content and random rants.

That's an incredibly impressive feat in its own right, but especially for a high school biology teacher like Prater.Prater is a biology teacher at Cheyenne Mountain High - where he also coaches the school's golf team - in Colorado Springs which tells you that he's a master of time management. He has a 20-month-old daughter at home as well, but somehow kept his game in good enough shape to play his way into the year's third major championship.\"My philosophy is keep the fundamentals sharp,\" he told GOLF. \"I spend a ton of time chipping and putting.\"  Players will have to showcase all sorts of shots around the greens of Pinehurst No. 2 this week if they're hoping to find any form of success.Prater and his caddie, Cole Anderson, are wisely picking the brains of the best players in the world heading into Thursday's opening round. On Tuesday, Prater teed it up with fellow Coloradan and defending U.S. Open champion Wyndham Clark. After that memorable round, Anderson went back out on the course to pick up some notes from Jordan Spieth's caddie, Michael Greller.READ: Grandstand Seats At U.S. Open Reportedly Collapsing On Fans Due To Construction MishapPlaying alongside Clark and soaking up some knowledge from one of the best caddies in the business is special, but things are set to get even better for Prater on Wednesday as he's set to play a practice round with the No. 1 player in the world, Scottie Scheffler.How the practice round came to be seems to be a bit of a mystery. It may have been Scheffler continuing his streak of being the nicest person in all of professional sports, but Prater thinks his caddie may have locked in the tee time when he met Ted Scott, Scheffler's caddie, early on in the week.No matter how Prater plays, it's already been a memorable week for the high school biology teacher from Colorado.\n","close      Video Americans react to Hunter Biden's conviction in federal gun trial Americans who spoke with Fox New Digital overwhelmingly agreed with the verdict but said it would not impact their vote in the 2024 election.  Americans across the country reacted to Hunter Biden's conviction in his federal gun case Tuesday, offering opinions on whether justice was served, if the verdict would affect their votes and the fallout of a possible pardon from his father.    Rhonda, a self-described conservative voter from Washington state, said the verdict hadn't changed her decision to vote against President Biden.\"I'm happy,\" she said, speaking with Fox News Digital in Washington, D.C. \"I think justice is definitely served.\"  Rhonda added that she wouldn't want to be put in the position of deciding whether to pardon her own son, which President Biden has said he would not do.   Hunter Biden departs from federal court, Tuesday, June 11, 2024, in Wilmington, Delaware.  (AP Photo/Matt Slocum)  HUNTER BIDEN FOUND GUILTY ON ALL COUNTS IN GUN TRIAL  \"I think as a father, that would be a very hard decision, more than as a president,\" she said. \"If it were my child, I would want to do everything I could to help them … It would be a tough spot, and I would not want to make that decision.\"Hunter Biden was found guilty in his federal trial in Wilmington, Delaware, of making a false statement in the purchase of a gun, making a false statement related to information required to be kept by a federally licensed gun dealer and possession of a gun by a person who is an unlawful user of or addicted to a controlled substance.  Chad, an Oregon native speaking in D.C., said he didn't have a strong reaction to the verdict, calling it the justice system \"doing its work.\"\"Anybody, whether they're famous or not, answers to whatever the jury decides,\" he told Fox News Digital.  Chad said he's inclined to support President Biden in November because of \"the alternative,\" noting it's \"his son's behavior, not his.\" He added that it wouldn't be appropriate for Hunter to receive a pardon.    \"I don't think he probably should or will, and I would think he wants to keep his nose clean for politics,\" Chad said.Brian, a Maryland native, wasn't surprised by the verdict.\"He admitted to it, so it is what it is,\" he said.

The presumptive GOP nominee was convicted last month on 34 felony charges of falsifying business documents.\"It should be blasted to the equivalent of how Trump’s trial was blasted on social media … all of last week it was all over every single Instagram page, Facebook, everything like that,\" the voter continued. \"That was blowing up, but I didn’t know anything about Biden’s trial.\"   The man’s friend, a Connecticut native who is also undecided but favoring Trump, believes everyone should be held to the same standards.\"If you commit a crime, you get the same punishment as anyone else,\" he said.   Melissa, from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, told Fox News Digital the verdict showed the justice system worked and called out what she viewed as conservative hypocrisy on the subject, alluding to critics of Trump's New York conviction.  \"I'm not surprised, because the justice system works, and none of the right-wing people are online right now complaining about how the justice system doesn't work because now it's Hunter Biden who's been found guilty,\" she said. \"I also want to point out Hunter Biden is not actually running for president, so just want to clarify that.\"Melissa said President Biden would keep his word about not pardoning Hunter and the verdict would \"absolutely not\" change her vote.  \"I'm going to vote for Biden. I'd vote for a refrigerator if it was running against Trump,\" she said.    Steve, also of Milwaukee, said \"the rule of law played out\" with Hunter's conviction.\"Let justice be served,\" he said, going on to say he hadn't considered whether Hunter would be pardoned but guessed it wouldn't happen.SOCIAL MEDIA ERUPTS OVER HUNTER BIDEN GUILTY VERDICT: COVERS THE BIDEN FAMILY’S ‘REAL CRIMES’  Terry in Birmingham, Michigan, said Hunter Biden deserves whatever sentence he receives.

(William Hennessy Jr.)  Bryson, speaking in New York, said a pardon of Hunter Biden could have an effect on his voting decision.\"I'm not sure if it would change my vote, but it would definitely impact it a little bit depending on what he does about it,\" Bryson told Fox News Digital.  Terry in Birmingham, Michigan, said Hunter Biden deserves whatever sentence he receives.\"He’s caused so much pain for his family,\" Terry told Fox News Digital. He also said he doesn’t think President Biden should pardon his son.     \"He should be obeying the laws, not breaking them and having daddy come bail you out,\" Terry said, before calling President Biden a \"crook.\"  \"He’s been sucking on the nipples of society,\" he added. \"I don’t understand how these people keep voting him in.\"HUNTER BIDEN TRIAL JUROR SAYS HE DIDN'T BUY DEFENSE'S 7-ELEVEN STORY  Rhonda, a self-described conservative, said she never planned to vote for President Biden regardless of the verdict.  (Fox News Digital/Megan Myers)A Birmingham native doesn’t believe the guilty verdict will influence his vote.     \"Our system is pretty corrupt across the board,\" he told Fox News Digital. Adrian, a staunch Biden supporter from Michigan, couldn’t care less about Hunter Biden’s conviction. \"I’m always going to vote for Biden over Trump,\" he told Fox News Digital.     Hunter Biden faces a total maximum prison time of 25 years for the three charges.

As fireworks burst in the sky on Independence Day 2018, Roxanne and Carter Maier were putting in yet another grueling 14-hour day of remodeling a former doctor's office into a dance studio in Brentwood, a small suburb of St. Louis, Missouri.    \"This is the last time we're doing this,\" the husband and wife team told each other multiple times throughout the move to their new location. Sweat poured down their faces as they ripped industrial carpet away from the concrete floor. They invested about $100,000 and countless hours renovating the building with the hopes of eventually purchasing it.But just a few years later, the city declared a strip of businesses — including the Maiers' — and small industrial buildings blighted. It moved to hand over the land to a private developer in a $436 million deal that seeks to use eminent domain to force out existing property owners and replace them with apartments, a hotel, office space, a microbrewery and stores.  The developer behind the project estimated it would generate more than $266 million in new revenue over the next 25 years.  Roxanne and Carter Maier moved their dance studio to Brentwood, Missouri, in 2018 and planned to eventually buy their building. Now, they may be forced to move again to make way for a large development and stand to lose the approximately $100,000 they say they poured into the building. (Courtesy Institute for Justice)  SUPREME COURT HEARS CASE OF TEXAS GRANDMOTHER THROWN IN JAIL AFTER CRITICIZING CITY GOVERNMENT  The Maiers, now in their 50s and 60s, are faced with the prospect of yet another move.\"At this point in our life,\" Carter said, \"do we want to go through again what we did last time?\"  Several business and property owners affected by the deal are suing, accusing the City of Brentwood of using a vague blight designation as a pretext to give their property to a private company. It’s a strategy local governments across the nation are using to skirt state eminent domain restrictions, according to their lawyers.Kelo v. New London: The SCOTUS case that changed everythingA 2005 Supreme Court ruling allowed cities like Brentwood to seize property in the name of economic development.  The catalyst for the case happened around the turn of the millennium in Connecticut. After pharmaceutical giant Pfizer built a plant in New London in 1998 — with the added bonus of an 80% tax abatement — the city wanted to revitalize the surrounding area. Officials approved a development plan that required seizing homes and selling the property to developers to build new commercial and residential complexes. The city also agreed to kick in $78 million for the project.    Susette Kelo and other property owners sued and were represented by the Institute for Justice, a nonprofit civil liberties law firm now representing the Brentwood businesses. They argued New London was violating the Fifth Amendment's takings clause, which prohibits the government from confiscating private property without just compensation. The property owners argued seizing their homes to sell to private companies was not a public use.But in a 5-4 opinion, the Supreme Court ruled that the seizure qualified as \"public use\" because the city was following an economic development plan, not just trying to benefit a certain group of private citizens.\"The specter of condemnation hangs over all property,\" Justice Sandra Day O’Connor wrote in her dissent. \"Nothing is to prevent the State from replacing any Motel 6 with a Ritz-Carlton, any home with a shopping mall, or any farm with a factory.\"  Roxanne and Carter Maier operate a dance studio and chiropractic office out of a building on Manchester Road. They've moved locations a few times since starting their business in 2005, but planned to stay in their current location and eventually buy the building. (Courtesy Institute for Justice)    BOTH SIDES CLAIM VICTORY AFTER SUPREME COURT RULES TEXAS RANCHER CAN SUE STATE OVER FLOODED LANDSWithin a year of the decision, local governments condemned or threatened eminent domain against nearly 6,000 homes, churches, businesses and other private properties, according to Institute for Justice researchers.The Supreme Court ruling also triggered a nationwide backlash, and soon, 43 state legislatures and eight state supreme courts strengthened protections for property owners, including Missouri, where lawmakers passed a bill in 2006 specifying that property can't be seized solely for economic development.  But Missouri and other states included a carve-out that would prove critical. Cities could still move to seize blighted areas, defined by Missouri law as having \"insanitary or unsafe conditions, deterioration of site improvements\" or other factors that present \"economic or social liability.\"    That broad definition can be used to condemn entire neighborhoods, even if individual homes or other properties are in spectacular condition, according to the state.Institute for Justice attorney Bob Belden, who represents the businesses in their lawsuit, said cities across the country are taking advantage of \"extremely elastic\" definitions of blight.  \"If you know anything about deterioration, by definition, the moment something is built, it starts to deteriorate,\" Belden said. \"So one problem that we see cities exploiting is a sort of lack of concrete detail on what the blight factors are.\"Brentwood officials declare area blighted, immediately threaten eminent domainDeer Creek meanders through the area behind the Maiers' dance studio and chiropractor office. It used to flood during heavy storms, damaging businesses on Manchester Road. So Roxanne Maier said she wasn't all that surprised when, in 2018, the city deemed the area blighted.  \"There were several properties in that time that were blighted,\" she said. \"They were not really in the best condition, but they had flooded every once in a while, and people weren't going to be putting a lot of money into a building that would flood again.\" Video  WATCH MORE FOX NEWS DIGITAL ORIGINALS HEREThen in 2019, the city launched a $95 million flood mitigation project, converting around 14 areas around the troublesome creek into green space. Officials at the time hoped that getting the area out of the flood plain would kickstart future development.  \"It's beautiful,\" Roxanne said of the improvements. Carter said people are already walking and jogging on new trails by the creek, and that in addition to the flood mitigation, the city installed fresh sidewalks, street lighting and repaved a large stretch of the formerly deteriorating Manchester Road.    So the Maiers and other business owners were shocked when the city again deemed the area blighted and announced a plan to have Green Street, a major St. Louis development firm, replace the small storefronts with a new, mixed-use development. Property owners could either sell willingly or be forced out by eminent domain under the plan.\"I have to sell my property, and lucky you, you get a property that’s out of a floodplain, and the roads are done and beautiful sidewalks,\" one property owner said during an Aug. 15, 2022, public meeting, gesturing at representatives of Green Street sitting behind her.  Plans for the Manchester Road redevelopment include a 30-unit condominium, a hotel, a 660 unit apartment complex, retail space and more. (Courtesy City of Brentwood/YouTube)The city's original blight designation eventually expired, according to business owners.  Then in 2023, despite investing heavily in improvements, Brentwood officials again declared 77 acres of Manchester Road blighted, a slightly smaller section than the original 2018 boundaries.  \"When they re-blighted it after they had done all these improvements, it made no sense,\" said Carolyn Wilson, who started a meal-prep business with her sister in 2004. \"But it also made us feel extremely vulnerable and powerless.\"A blight study the city published in 2023 listed few specific problem properties, but noted that about 60% of buildings were 52 years old or older, meaning they \"likely contain hazardous materials and unsafe conditions.\"    Photos taken between 2022 and 2023 and included in a city presentation showed wooden pallets propped up near a trash can, seemingly-unoccupied buildings, loose bricks in a wall and parking lots with cracked or crumbling pavement. The city noted that newer buildings in the area needed fresh paint or other repairs.  The City of Brentwood included these photos, taken in 2022 and 2023, in its blight study summary last year. The city had previously declared the area blighted in 2018, before starting a series of infrastructural improvements, including flood mitigation. (Courtesy City of Brentwood)GRANDMOTHER WINS $4 MILLION AFTER SWAT RAIDED WRONG HOME BASED ON FIND MY IPHONE APP  The study also found that the private properties in \"poor condition will generate less tax revenues than similarly situated properties in better condition.\" Therefore, the area \"constitutes an economic liability,\" the city wrote in its presentation.  \"It's bogus,\" said Bob Story, who runs Feather-Craft, a fly-fishing business his father founded in 1955 and has been located on Manchester Road since 1989. \"This area looks exactly like every other area around here in Brentwood.\"Story added, \"It's all about the tax revenue.\"The city declined an interview request and would not comment on the development plans or the lawsuit.    \"Under the law, eminent domain is legal to address a blighted area,\" Brentwood Mayor David Dimmit said during a July 2023 public meeting. \"That has always been part of the process.\"  He argued having a master redeveloper like Green Street take over the entire area would create a cohesive, thriving area, which wouldn't be possible by simply purchasing a few properties here and there.Later that month, the Board of Aldermen approved an ordinance to redevelop around 40 acres of the area. Construction was scheduled to begin in 2025, and Green Street would need to acquire all the properties within the redevelopment boundaries, local media reported.  Bob Story stands inside his business, Feather-Craft Fly Fishing, which has been located on Manchester Road since 1989. (Courtesy Institute for Justice)  IJ's lawsuit alleges businesses in the area were never informed that their properties were considered blighted and that city officials never told the plaintiffs their properties could be seized. The suit further argues the city failed to present substantial evidence of deterioration or unsafe conditions and merely used the blight designation as a pretext to seize private property on Green Street's behalf.  Representatives for Green Street did not return multiple emails and phone calls seeking comment on the project. In proposals for the development, the company estimated the project would generate more than $266 million in new revenue over the next 25 years, including nearly $42 million in taxes for local jurisdictions and $51.6 million for the Brentwood School District.But the company is also facing internal issues.  Green Street owes the city of St. Louis nearly $800,000 in delinquent property taxes, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported in December. Contractors filed dozens of lawsuits against the company, many of which have since been resolved, claiming they hadn't been paid for their work. And last year, the company laid off a half dozen employees, blaming \"current levels of economic activity,\" the Post-Dispatch reported.Green Street's lobbyist did not answer questions about the property taxes or other problems, local outlets reported.The road ahead for business owners    \"The case raises the question of whether anybody in the United States really owns their property if all it takes for the government to take it away from you is that the government can come by and think, ‘Well, I could probably use this property better,’\" Belden, the Institute for Justice attorney, told Fox News Digital.  And while property owners will be paid if their buildings are seized, renters like the Maiers, Story and Wilson aren't entitled to much other than what's in their lease agreements and possible relocation assistance, Belden said. Wilson and her sister fear moving would make it difficult for their business to survive.\"We've been in our present location for 20 years, and we're well known in the area and everybody knows where we are,\" she said. \"They're used to coming to our current location.\"Belden sees echoes of the Kelo case, which he called one of the Supreme Court's \"most widely reviled decisions,\" in the Brentwood fight, as well as a cautionary tale.    Crews tore down dozens of houses and bulldozed the New London neighborhood, but nearly two decades after the Supreme Court victory authorizing it, most of the land remains a barren lot.Pfizer shuttered its plant just before its tax breaks expired, scrapping 1,400 jobs and moving its operations a few miles away to another campus to cut costs. Earlier this year, crews laid the foundation for a future community center on a small portion of the land. Other parcels have recently been sold to companies hoping to build apartments and a hotel.\"To this day, the property where [Kelo's] home used to sit is vacant,\" Belden said. \"The only thing that has occupied the property there at any point has been feral animals.\"  The neighborhood where plaintiff Susette Kelo's house used to sit remained a vacant lot for nearly 20 years after the city of New London seized it for a development that never materialized.

Four years later, some departments still can’t stop the bleeding.Seattle’s police staffing is at its lowest level since the 1990s, according to a March KING 5 report. Earlier this year in California, the Alameda Police Department offered a $75,000 signing bonus — the highest in the nation — on top of a six-figure starting salary to try to entice new officers.  And while Lovell said Idaho hasn't been immune to recruiting challenges, the state also saw a wave of out-of-state police applications around the same time other departments began losing officers.     CRISIS IN NORTHWEST: ARE VOTERS 'BEYOND A TURNING POINT' AFTER DECADES OF PROGRESSIVE POLITICS? ALL ROADS 'LEAD BACK TO FENTANYL': CITY OVERRUN WITH DRUGS SEES PROGRESS AFTER OVERWHELMED POLICE GET NEW HELPThe number of officers from other states who applied for certification in Idaho more than doubled from 2019 to 2021, according to data from the Idaho Peace Officer Standards & Training (POST). While the annual applications have dwindled since then, they remain above pre-2020 levels.    Lovell said officers from other states have called him, looking for employment. Many were frustrated with local policies that defunded police departments or decriminalized drugs, he said.\"The district attorney doesn't back them, there's too much liability, so the department won't let them enforce the law, which is their job,\" Horst said. \"And that bugs a lot of people.\" VideoWATCH MORE FOX NEWS DIGITAL ORIGINALS HERE  \"They get a job up here, oftentimes taking a huge pay cut because the pay here does not compare to a lot of states,\" he added. \"But it's worth it to them to raise their families in a place that is safe and has those old-school values.\"    An officer joining the Coeur d’Alene Police Department could expect to make between $63,000 and $89,000 per year before overtime, according to a recent job posting. The range is larger for the Idaho State Patrol, starting at about $48,000 per year but going up to nearly $103,000.But the biggest blue boost in Idaho comes from retirees, Lovell and Horst said.  Retired police officers from Los Angeles, San Diego and other Golden State cities gather regularly for coffee, said Horst, who keeps up with several retiree groups. Around 40 former Seattle officers also live in the area, he added. It makes sense — California, Washington and Oregon are the three states fueling Idaho's rapid population growth.  Horst sets himself apart from other real estate agents in North Idaho by putting his law enforcement background front and center.

NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!\n","  We are all feeling the effects of stubborn and persistent inflation. When the current administration tells us inflation is coming down, we must remind ourselves that only means already high prices are going up slower. When a few large pizzas, some salads, and garlic knots cost you $100, you begin to realize just how expensive life is getting for Americans.      So, is there any chance that prices will ever come down? The one thing, good or bad, that could make that happen is the D word: Deflation.What Is Deflation?Deflation, characterized by a general decline in prices for goods and services, is a stark contrast to inflation. While inflation erodes purchasing power, deflation increases it. However, deflation can signal severe economic distress and widespread economic stagnation. Understanding how deflation can occur in the United States involves a combination of economic factors, policies and external influences.  Will prices ever come down? (istock)Key Drivers of Deflation… It’s Me, I’m The Problem?  Decreased Consumer Demand: When consumers and businesses expect prices to fall, they may delay purchases and investments. This reduced demand can lead to an oversupply of goods and services, forcing prices downward. As Taylor Swift says, \"It’s me, I’m the problem.\" Perhaps the answer is we, as Americans, need to be spending less than we do today.  BIDEN REPEATS FALSE CLAIM THAT INFLATION WAS AT 9% WHEN HE TOOK OFFICE AFTER BEING CALLED OUT LAST WEEK  Technological Advancements: Technological progress can enhance productivity and reduce production costs, so perhaps rapid AI growth could solve our inflation problem.Monetary Policy: Are the Fed’s current policies too tight? Should they be raising interest rates even though it’s not what Americans want right now? Tightening rates even further might be the solution in part to solving the inflation issue. Video  Debt Deflation: High levels of debt can lead to deflation if consumers and businesses focus on paying down debt rather than spending or investing. With all of this consumer debt – $1.1 trillion of credit card alone – it could actually help with deflation if it accelerates even faster although some families will suffer greatly.Global Economic Conditions: Deflationary pressures can also be imported through international trade. A global slowdown or recession can reduce demand for U.S. exports, while cheaper imports can lead to domestic price declines.  BIDEN DISMISSES LOW CONSUMER CONFIDENCE ON THE ECONOMY: 'WE'VE ALREADY TURNED IT AROUND'Historical Context    The Great Depression of the 1930s is a classic example of deflation in the United States. During this period, the country experienced severe deflation, with prices falling by nearly 30%. The deflationary spiral was driven by a combination of high debt levels, bank failures and a collapse in consumer confidence. More recently, Japan’s \"Lost Decade\" in the 1990s serves as a cautionary tale of how prolonged deflation can stifle economic growth.  VideoNone of this sounds good for America, but it may sober people into realizing that prices may remain exactly where they are for a long time, with no chance of coming down.Potential Pathways to DeflationPost-Pandemic Economic Shifts: The COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented government spending and monetary easing to support the economy. As these supports are withdrawn -- meaning the government stops spending money – the potential for reduced consumer and business spending could emerge, especially if confidence in economic recovery wanes.

Authorities say commercial shipping traffic through the Port of Baltimore will soon return to normal levels since the waterway fully reopened earlier this week for the first time since the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse.Officials estimate the salvage operations will cost up to $75 million, and rebuilding the bridge could cost nearly $2 billion.The exact causes of the electrical issues that caused the cargo ship Dali to lose power and crash into the bridge have yet to be determined.Authorities anticipate commercial shipping traffic through the Port of Baltimore will soon return to normal levels since the channel fully reopened earlier this week for the first time since the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse.    \"They are back open for business, ready to bring in the largest container ships that call there,\" U.S. Coast Guard Rear Admiral Shannon Gilreath said during a virtual press briefing Tuesday afternoon.Some shipping companies rerouted their cargo to other ports following the deadly bridge collapse in March. The disaster halted most maritime traffic through Baltimore’s busy port as crews worked around the clock to clear an estimated 50,000 tons of fallen steel and concrete from the Patapsco River — a roughly $100 million effort that involved federal, state and local agencies, officials said.  COAST GUARD STUDYING IF OTHER BRIDGES AT RISK FOLLOWING BALTIMORE BRIDGE DISASTER  Companies that steered clear of Baltimore during the cleanup efforts will likely come back now that the channel has been returned to its original depth and width, officials said. The city’s port processes more cars and farm equipment than any other in the country.  All that rerouted commercial traffic \"belongs in Baltimore today,\" U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said. \"We have every indication that that is what is taking place, but we will be reinforcing that expectation as we speak with players up and down the supply chains.\"Crews were able to reopen portions of the deep-draft channel in phases, restoring some commercial traffic in recent weeks. Some cruise ships and large container ships have already passed through, officials said.  Salvage crews continue to clean up wreckage from the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in the Patapsco River on June 11, 2024, in Baltimore, Maryland.

Rebuilding the bridge could cost nearly $2 billion, officials have said. They hope it’s completed by 2028.    The Biden administration approved $60 million in immediate federal aid, which Buttigieg referred to as \"a down payment on the work ahead.\" All of that aid has been committed, said White House Deputy Chief of Staff Natalie Quillian.President Joe Biden has pledged that the federal government will cover the full cost of rebuilding the bridge, though officials said the funding is still awaiting approval from Congress.In a statement Tuesday, Biden praised the work of everyone involved in the recovery effort to date.    \"Baltimore can count on us to stick with them every step of the way, and we will continue to have your back until the bridge is rebuilt,\" he said.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe cargo ship Dali crashed into a critical support column of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in the early hours of March 26, collapsing the span and sending six members of a roadwork crew plunging to their deaths. The ship had lost power shortly after leaving Baltimore for Sri Lanka. A National Transportation Safety Board investigation found it experienced power outages before starting its voyage, but the exact causes of the electrical issues have yet to be determined. The FBI is also conducting a criminal investigation into the circumstances leading up to the collapse.  The Dali remained stuck amid the wreckage for almost two months, with a massive steel truss draped across its damaged bow. On May 20, the ship was refloated and guided back to port. That allowed officials to open a channel that was 50 feet deep and 400 feet wide, big enough for most of the largest commercial vessels.    The full federal shipping channel is 700 feet wide. Officials said two-way traffic can resume now that it has reopened. They said additional safety requirements have also been lifted because of the increased width.\n","close      Video 'Far-left green activists' storm BlackRock's NYC headquarters, 'shut down entry' Multiple climate protesters \"shut down entry\" to BlackRock after they stormed the barricades outside the company's New York City headquarters. (New York Communities for Change) BlackRock announced Tuesday that it is partnering with a third proxy advisory firm to give its clients a wider range of investment counsel as a leading expert suggested the mammoth asset manager is trying to make up for allegations that it leans into ESG (environmental, social, governance) tenets more than its fiduciary responsibilities merit.    In a release obtained by Fox News Digital on Monday, BlackRock officials said the firm remains committed to providing its clients with choices that support their growing range of investment preferences via its Voting Choice program.\"We continue to innovate and provide more choice to our clients who wish to take a more direct role in the proxy voting process,\" Joud Abdel Majeid, global head of BlackRock Investment Stewardship, said in the release.   \"We’re pleased to add a third proxy advisor to our platform and the option for more clients to customize their voting guidelines to reflect their specific goals and objectives.\"  ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP IS THE NEW GUISE FOR MERCANTILISM, CAN LEAD TO GLOBAL INSTABILITY: DR KEVIN ROBERTS Video  In that regard, BlackRock will be adding Delaware County, Pa.-based ratings firm Egan Jones as a third proxy adviser beginning in July.

But a top public policy expert who has long spoken out against the politicization of the financial services sector told Fox News Digital that BlackRock is not successfully affirming any kind of apolitical fiduciary stance by bringing Egan Jones into its advisory fold.Dr. Kevin Roberts, president of the Heritage Foundation, said BlackRock’s move was tardy at best.Blackrock CEO \"Larry Fink may claim that ESG has ‘been weaponized by left and right,’\" he said, referencing a July 2023 Fox Business interview with Fink. \"But he’s missing the reality: Everyday Americans recognize ESG for the scam it is.\"    In the interview, Fink told Fox Business host Liz Claman that BlackRock is seeing more new investors than any time in its history, and he responded to ESG-minded critics by saying the firm remains a fiduciary that does \"what our clients are asking.\"CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Video\"We have good performance, and we've been right on market calls,\" Fink said.  \"BlackRock may consider additional policies for the Voting Choice program based on client interest,\" another official said.    In his 2023 chairman's letter to investors, Fink somewhat addressed Roberts' overall criticism, writing that \"there are many people with opinions about how we should manage our clients’ money. But the money doesn’t belong to these people. It’s not ours either. It belongs to our clients, and our responsibility and our duty is to them.\"In his comments to Fox News Digital, Roberts said many states are nonetheless seeking to \"eliminate the politics in boardrooms of America’s companies.\"  \"BlackRock’s move to expand 'voting choice' touted under the guise of a ‘commitment to providing clients with choices’ is too little, too late,\" he said, pointing to right-wing gains in France and the European Parliament that show citizens are \"fed up with being pawns in global elites’ war on common sense.\"BlackRock’s release said that prior to the addition of Egan Jones, $600 billion in institutional investment assets under management were entrusted to the Voting Choice program.

Fox News host Jesse Watters reacts to Hunter Biden's guilty conviction on all three counts he faced in a federal gun case in Delaware on \"Jesse Watters Primetime.\"    HUNTER BIDEN FOUND GUILTY ON ALL COUNTS IN GUN TRIALJESSE WATTERS: Guilty, guilty, guilty, was the verdict handed down by a jury of Hunter Biden's peers. For the first time in his life Hunter faced the music. Two counts of lying on a gun form, one count of possession of a firearm by a drug user. Hunter Biden appeared wide-eyed and motionless as he became the first child of a sitting president to be convicted of a crime. Three felonies, Hunter now facing a maximum of 25 years in prison, but the sentencing guidelines suggest just a couple although the judge could deviate and do whatever she wants, sentencing will probably occur before September 5th when Hunter goes on trial in LA for tax evasion. That means Hunter could be sentenced to prison just days before the second presidential debate. He'll obviously appeal.   The jury followed the law. The judge ran a tight trial and justice was served. But just because one Democrat was convicted doesn't mean the American legal system isn't being abused. The feds are still throwing dozens of Republicans in prison on trumped up charges and trying to incarcerate the Republican nominee for a crime they cooked up with black magic to hocus pocus an election. Hunter's judge didn't donate to a group called Stop Democrats, either. The media celebrated the Trump verdict like a July 4th barbecue, but treated Hunter's like a funeral.

Steve Bannon, a longtime ally of former President Trump, filed an emergency motion on Tuesday seeking to keep him out of prison as he pursues an appeal – possibly to the U.S. Supreme Court – on his conviction for defying a Jan. 6 House committee subpoena.     The motion filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia requests a ruling by June 18 – before Bannon’s surrender date of July 1 – to allow sufficient time to seek further relief from the Supreme Court if necessary. Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington agreed to the Justice Department's request to require that Bannon report to prison on July 1 after a federal appeals court panel in May upheld his contempt of Congress conviction.\"There is also no denying the political realities here. Mr. Bannon is a high-profile political commentator and campaign strategist. He was prosecuted by an administration whose policies are a frequent target of Mr. Bannon’s public statements,\" the motion says. \"The government seeks to imprison Mr. Bannon for the four-month period leading up to the November election, when millions of Americans look to him for information on important campaign issues. This would also effectively bar Mr. Bannon from serving as a meaningful advisor in the ongoing national campaign.\"  \"This is a landmark case. The prosecution pursued a novel and aggressive theory of liability, and the case garnered international attention,\" Bannon’s lawyer, R. Trent McCotter, wrote. \"If the panel decision stands, there will be far-reaching consequences, including separation-of-powers concerns. Before the prosecution of Mr. Bannon, it had been 50 years since the government convinced a jury to convict someone for not adequately responding to a congressional subpoena—and there has certainly been no shortage of disputes over congressional subpoenas during that time.\"  JUDGE ORDERS STEVE BANNON TO REPORT TO PRISON  Steve Bannon, former adviser to former President Trump, center, and attorney Matthew Evan Corcoran, left, depart the courthouse on June 6, 2024 in Washington, D.C. (Kent Nishimura/Getty Images)  Bannon was convicted nearly two years ago of two counts of contempt of Congress: one for refusing to sit for a deposition with the Jan. 6 House Committee and the other for refusing to provide documents related to his involvement in Trump’s efforts to have the 2020 presidential election results showing a victory for President Biden overturned. Nichols, nominated by Trump to the bench in 2018, had initially allowed Bannon to remain free while he fought his conviction because the judge believed the case raised substantial legal questions. However, during a hearing in Washington's federal court, Nichols said the calculus changed after a three-judge District of Columbia appeals court panel said all of Bannon’s challenges lack merit.  The motion Tuesday comes after Trump was convicted on 34 felony charges in his New York City hush money trial and faces a sentencing hearing next month just four days before the Republican National Convention, where the GOP will likely declare him their official 2024 presidential nominee.

(Curtis Means-Pool/Getty Images)Bannon \"intends to vigorously pursue his remaining appeals in this case and has retained experienced Supreme Court counsel,\" his lawyers wrote Tuesday, asking the court to allow him to remain on release given there is \"no dispute that Mr. Bannon ‘is not likely to flee or pose a danger to the safety of any other person or the community if released’ —indeed, he has been out on release for years now without incident, and his ‘crime’ was non-violent.\"  HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE INVESTIGATES 'MANIPULATED' EVIDENCE SEIZED BY FBI IN TRUMP CLASSIFIED RECORDS PROBE    \"Mr. Bannon faced what the Court has described as a novel scenario: Congress was pursuing documents and testimony from a former executive branch official, yet counsel for the former President himself required Mr. Bannon to protect executive privilege in responding to the subpoena,\" the motion says. \"Mr. Bannon followed the advice of his counsel and requested that the Committee resolve the privilege issues with the holder of that privilege, or have the matter resolved in a civil suit.\" Bannon’s lawyer at trial argued that the former adviser did not ignore the subpoena, but was still engaged in good-faith negotiations with the congressional committee when he was charged.The defense has said Bannon had been acting on the advice of his attorney at the time, who told him that the subpoena was invalid because the committee would not allow a Trump lawyer in the room and that Bannon could not determine what documents or testimony he could provide because Trump asserted executive privilege.

Schoen said the case raises \"serious constitutional issues\" that need to be examined by the Supreme Court.\"In this country, we don't send anyone to prison if they believe that they were doing something that complied with the law,\" he told reporters.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  A second Trump aide, trade adviser Peter Navarro, was also convicted of contempt of Congress.

The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the two measures do not violate the rights of firearm sellers or buyers. The ruling on Tuesday overturns a federal judge's ruling in October that blocked the laws.State Sen. Dave Min, a Democrat, introduced both laws: the first went into effect in January 2022 and prohibited gun shows at the Orange County Fair, while the other went into effect last year and extended the ban to county fairgrounds on state-owned land.  U.S. District Judge Mark Holcomb wrote in his decision last year that the state was violating the rights of gun sellers and potential buyers by barring purchases of firearms that can be bought at any gun store and that lawful gun sales involve commercial speech protected by the First Amendment.

But the appeals court disagreed, writing that there were six licensed firearms dealers in the same ZIP code as the Orange County Fairgrounds, where the 2022 law banned gun sales.

(Spencer Colby/The Canadian Press via AP)  Trudeau responded: \"I think it’s extremely important that we continue to take foreign interference with all the seriousness that it requires, which is why we will be supporting the Bloc Québécois motion to send the report and the concerns raised in it to Commissioner [Marie-Josée] Hogue's work to make sure there is a clear process whereby Canadians can have confidence in the integrity of the democracy.\" Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre called on Truduea’s Liberal government to name the lawmakers referenced in the redacted report, but Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc said doing so would be against the law. LeBlance said he did agree, however, to an expanded public inquiry sought by the Bloc Québécois.   The Bloc Québécois introduced a motion to broaden the scope of the Hogue Commission, which was already investigating foreign interference and elected meddling since September, \"to investigate parliamentarians who may have voluntarily or involuntarily worked for the interests of powers foreign.\" Trudeau first tasked Justice Marie-Josée Hogue with leading the commission last fall amid allegations the Chinese government mobilized voters against a Conservative candidate in western Canada and helped elect another candidate as a Liberal in the Toronto area, Politico reported. \"Certain members of this House acted in the best interest of hostile foreign regimes interfering in Canada's democracy.

European voters largely rejected socialism and leftist policies at the polls on Sunday. \"We have seen around the world a rise of populist right-wing forces in just about every democracy that we’ve seen.

NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!\n","  We are all feeling the effects of stubborn and persistent inflation. When the current administration tells us inflation is coming down, we must remind ourselves that only means already high prices are going up slower. When a few large pizzas, some salads, and garlic knots cost you $100, you begin to realize just how expensive life is getting for Americans.      So, is there any chance that prices will ever come down? The one thing, good or bad, that could make that happen is the D word: Deflation.What Is Deflation?Deflation, characterized by a general decline in prices for goods and services, is a stark contrast to inflation. While inflation erodes purchasing power, deflation increases it. However, deflation can signal severe economic distress and widespread economic stagnation. Understanding how deflation can occur in the United States involves a combination of economic factors, policies and external influences.  Will prices ever come down? (istock)Key Drivers of Deflation… It’s Me, I’m The Problem?  Decreased Consumer Demand: When consumers and businesses expect prices to fall, they may delay purchases and investments. This reduced demand can lead to an oversupply of goods and services, forcing prices downward. As Taylor Swift says, \"It’s me, I’m the problem.\" Perhaps the answer is we, as Americans, need to be spending less than we do today.  BIDEN REPEATS FALSE CLAIM THAT INFLATION WAS AT 9% WHEN HE TOOK OFFICE AFTER BEING CALLED OUT LAST WEEK  Technological Advancements: Technological progress can enhance productivity and reduce production costs, so perhaps rapid AI growth could solve our inflation problem.Monetary Policy: Are the Fed’s current policies too tight? Should they be raising interest rates even though it’s not what Americans want right now? Tightening rates even further might be the solution in part to solving the inflation issue. Video  Debt Deflation: High levels of debt can lead to deflation if consumers and businesses focus on paying down debt rather than spending or investing. With all of this consumer debt – $1.1 trillion of credit card alone – it could actually help with deflation if it accelerates even faster although some families will suffer greatly.Global Economic Conditions: Deflationary pressures can also be imported through international trade. A global slowdown or recession can reduce demand for U.S. exports, while cheaper imports can lead to domestic price declines.  BIDEN DISMISSES LOW CONSUMER CONFIDENCE ON THE ECONOMY: 'WE'VE ALREADY TURNED IT AROUND'Historical Context    The Great Depression of the 1930s is a classic example of deflation in the United States. During this period, the country experienced severe deflation, with prices falling by nearly 30%. The deflationary spiral was driven by a combination of high debt levels, bank failures and a collapse in consumer confidence. More recently, Japan’s \"Lost Decade\" in the 1990s serves as a cautionary tale of how prolonged deflation can stifle economic growth.  VideoNone of this sounds good for America, but it may sober people into realizing that prices may remain exactly where they are for a long time, with no chance of coming down.Potential Pathways to DeflationPost-Pandemic Economic Shifts: The COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented government spending and monetary easing to support the economy. As these supports are withdrawn -- meaning the government stops spending money – the potential for reduced consumer and business spending could emerge, especially if confidence in economic recovery wanes.    CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONPolicy Missteps: If the Federal Reserve and other policymakers misjudge economic conditions and tighten monetary policy too aggressively, they could inadvertently trigger deflationary pressures. Conversely, a failure to address high levels of corporate and consumer debt could also contribute to a deflationary spiral. VideoGlobal Economic Weakness: Ongoing trade tensions, geopolitical instability, or another global financial crisis could reduce demand for U.S. exports, increasing deflationary risks. A strong dollar, while beneficial for imports, could exacerbate deflation by making U.S. exports less competitive.Be Careful What You Ask For, You Just Might Get It  Deflation, while seemingly beneficial because we all want lower prices, can lead to severe economic consequences.

Trump supporters wait a line to attend outside Crotona Park in Bronx on May 23, 2024. (Jeenah Moon for The Washington Post via Getty Images)   Not only was the rally historic, but the anti-conventional-wisdom Trump also exposed a hidden and often censored truth. The Democrats don’t have a lock on the votes in our inner cities or within the minority community.  TRUMP GETS WARM RECEPTION AND PILES OF CAMPAIGN CASH DURING SUNNY BLUE STATE SWING  All of which raises a critically important question: How many untapped votes are there in the deep blue cities of Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Chicago, Washington, D.C., Atlanta and elsewhere? Millions to be sure.   In so many ways, minority and inner-city residents are the brightest and most aware of all voters. Because failing political policies often batter them every single day of their lives. They understand the harsh realities of life better than most. As such, they are open to solutions that might deliver them from such misery. More than that, they are desperate for such solutions.  Video  That said, it’s unfair to ask for their vote if you are not willing to present yourself to them and offer up your solutions to their many problems. Openness, respect and trust must be a two-way street.To paraphrase the movie \"Field of Dreams,\" if you offer up that in-person attendance and respect, \"they will come.\" And potentially in historic numbers for a Republican candidate.  FIVE OF THE MOST EYEBROW-RAISING LIBERAL REACTIONS TO TRUMP'S BRONX RALLY    That exact same formula also applies to the \"deep blue\" high-tech community. Over the last two decades, I have interacted with dozens of high-tech entrepreneurs from Silicon Valley and other perceived blue bastions of liberalism and wokeism.   VideoAnd within these strongholds of far-left elitism and loyalty to failed Democratic policies are thousands of high-tech employees – and, indeed, CEOs – who recognize that the failed policies of the far-left are destroying society about them and putting their very lives in danger. These men and women will rally around commonsense, pragmatic solutions that reinforce the rule of law.   What Trump clearly understands is that presidential elections are ultimately won by shaving off one-half of 1% in a district; one-quarter of 1% in a county, and one-eighth of 1% in a state. As we saw in 2020, less than 60,000 votes can flip a presidential election.    It can certainly be argued that Trump has the most impressive road show in America. A road show that brings out huge crowds while creating massive word of mouth and new voters. A road show that will play in blue states, blue cities and blue \"high-tech,\" as proved in New Jersey, the Bronx, and of late, California.TRUMP VERDICT FIRES UP THE DONOR CLASS LEADING TO MASSIVE MAY FUNDRAISING HAUL VideoLast week, billionaire entrepreneur David Sacks co-hosted a fundraiser for Trump in his San Francisco home with Democrat mega-donor and former Facebook executive Chamath Palihapitiya. The goal was to raise $5 million. The sold-out event brought in $12 million. Why?  As Sacks pointed out to Laura Ingraham in part last week:    \"I know there's a lot of people out there who are already Trump supporters, and they're just afraid to stick their necks out. I mean, that's the reality of the situation because they're afraid of getting ostracized or afraid of cancel culture. They're afraid of punishment, and they're afraid because the Biden administration likes political prosecutions and political investigations… With each incremental person who sticks their neck out and endorses Trump, it makes the rest of them feel more comfortable doing it, and you're seeing, I think, a cascade starting to happen now, where more and more people are going to come out for Trump.\" VideoCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION  True. But a \"cascade\" can only flow if the wall is penetrated or even toppled.    Since 2015, Trump has proved himself to be the \"counterintuitive candidate.\" He marches to the beat of his own drum and his instincts often prove unerringly correct.

Gavin Newsom was astride the national political stage as people wondered whether he would be running for president. Now, Newsom is nowhere to be found outside California. The reasons are simple and they include the failing state of California.    In 2023, Gavin Newsom positioned himself well among Democrats. Many thought he was running for president. He took the fight to Republicans on numerous issues such as the climate, abortion and the economy. Newsom was seen on national TV repeatedly and even positioned himself as the foil to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who actually was running for president.Newsom, however, has disappeared from the national stage – even though some still speculate that Biden should be replaced at the convention. Here are five reasons why he has disappeared – and shouldn’t be brought back.  California Gov. Gavin Newsom and President Biden (Getty Images)Newsom’s Failed Debate With DeSantis  Newsom’s peak on the national stage was his debate with Ron DeSantis. Contrary to what many have said, that debate did not go well for Newsom. It was the first time the nation had access to an unscripted Newsom for an extended period time.    CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA: HAMAS-STYLE ATTACK COULD HAPPEN TO US, BORDER MAYOR WARNS AS MIGRANT SURGE CONTINUES  As someone who won the post U.S. Senate debate poll against Kamala Harris in 2016, it is my view that there are three things any candidate must do in a big debate. They must answer the questions, they must propose solutions and they must be likable.Newsom accomplished none of those things. He was not likable. His own wife pulled him off the stage after Newsom agreed to extend the debate. Newsom proposed few solutions and chose to attack DeSantis more than answer questions.  Video  Since that debate, Newsom has all but disappeared from the national stage.Newsom’s Distraction from Biden’s Campaign Had to EndFor a period of time, it helped the Democrats that Newsom was taking the fight to Republicans. Newsom was good at attacking Republicans when he did not have to answer questions about his own record.    GAVIN NEWSOM CALLED 'DELUSIONAL' AFTER TOUTING CALIFORNIA AS NATIONAL MODEL ON FIGHTING HOMELESSNESS    However, once Biden made it clear he was not going to step aside, Newsom’s young virile forays against Republicans became a problem for Biden. It took the spotlight from Biden and fueled the calls for Biden to step aside. So, instead, Newsom stepped aside. VideoCalifornia is a Mess and Getting WorseOn that debate stage with DeSantis, Gavin Newsom boasted, as he usually does, about how great California is. The pictures and numbers say otherwise.Less than week after that debate, a CBS Sacramento affiliate ran this headline: \"What contributed to California's record $68 billion budget deficit?\" That deficit has gotten \"progressively\" worse since then and big spending cuts are required – never a calling card for Democrats running for president.    Of course, crime is out of control in California. Here are some headlines: CALIFORNIA'S NEWSOM ATTACKED FROM HIS LEFT IN TEACHERS UNION AD BLITZ: 'MONUMENTAL CRISIS' Video\"South American gangs armed with knives are running wild on Los Angeles highways targeting terrified jewelers in brazen daytime robberies – slashing tires, shattering windows and even planting trackers on their cars.\"  \"ABC News correspondent victim of car 'smash and grab' in Oakland, feels 'sad for the folks that do this' – Violent crime, robbery and vehicle theft in Oakland increased by over 20% in 2023.\"    Now Newsom is proposing reduced spending on public safety because of the deficit.Homelessness is also out of control. So too is the wasteful spending by Newsom on the problem. These two recent headlines capture that story: \"California fails to track its homelessness spending or results, a new audit says\" and \"California spent $24B on homeless crisis but problem didn’t improve in many cities: auditor’s report.\" Video  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERCalifornia is Ground Zero for the Nationwide Insurance CrisisAll across the country, a home insurance crisis in on the rise. However, \"California's insurance crisis dates to Proposition 103, a 1988 ballot initiative that rolled back existing rates.\"  Matters have only become worse over the years. In 2023, this story ran about California: \"Seven of California’s largest property insurers, State Farm, Allstate, Farmers, USAA, Travelers, Nationwide and Chubb recently decided to limit new homeowners policies in the Golden State, raising questions about the stability of the California home insurance.\"California’s Housing Crisis  Beyond the insurance problem, \"only 15% of Californians can afford a home.\" According to California’s Public Policy Institute, that problem \"has been decades in the making.\" That was their assessment in 2020. VideoFor the people that live in California, none of that is news. They live with those problems every day – or not. Hundreds of thousands of people have left California for greener pastures. Under Newsom’s watch, California lost a congressional seat due to population lost for the first time in its history.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP    Those are just some of the low lights of Newsom’s record. When Newsom put himself in the national spotlight, it might well have been the first time that many people focused on his record.  Altogether, those problems and Newsom’s bad debate performance, are the reasons Newsom has retreated from the national stage – for now.

Can Alzheimer’s disease be reversed?    Dr. Heather Sandison, a renowned expert in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia care, believes that reversal isn’t just possible — but that it’s already happening in multiple patients. In her new book \"Reversing Alzheimer's: The New Tool Kit to Improve Cognition and Protect Brain Health,\" which was published by HarperCollins on June 11, Sandison — who is based in California — offers a step-by-step guide to helping Alzheimer’s patients improve their overall brain health.  NEW ALZHEIMER’S TREATMENT ACCELERATES REMOVAL OF PLAQUE FROM THE BRAIN IN CLINICAL TRIALS  One of the core elements of Sandison’s program is a focus on exercise as one of the most important lifestyle factors in preventing and controlling dementia.   Research has shown that physical activity can reduce the likelihood and progression of Alzheimer’s.   Dr. Heather Sandison, at left, is a naturopathic doctor specializing in neurocognitive medicine and the founder of Solcere Health Clinic, San Diego’s premier brain optimization clinic, and Marama, the first residential memory care facility to have the goal of returning cognitively declined residents to independent living. (Dr. Heather Sandison/iStock)In the excerpt below, Sandison offers some specific recommendations for the types of exercise that can benefit patients living with the disease. Read an excerpt from ‘Reversing Alzheimer’s'  Dr. Heather Sandison: Need a new motivation to be active? Exercise is medicine for the brain and provides an amazing array of benefits. Most obviously, exercise increases blood flow throughout the body, including to the brain. That means getting your body moving will deliver more oxygen and nutrients to your brain while also flushing away more waste products.   Exercise also strengthens the heart and cardiovascular system, which helps improve blood flow even when you’re not working out; it also reduces the risk of arterial plaques that might disrupt blood flow to the brain and contribute to dementia.    ALL ABOUT ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE: SIGNS, SYMPTOMS AND STAGESThe overarching reason that exercise is such a powerful health protector is that it is what’s known as a hormetic, or a beneficial stressor. Basically, when you put your body through its paces, the body is forced to use up resources, and your tissues can even be broken down a bit. (That’s what happens when you lift weights: Your muscles tear a tiny bit.)   Dr. Heather Sandison, an expert in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia care, believes that reversal isn’t just possible but that it’s already happening in multiple patients.  (Dr. Heather Sandison)    In that sense, you’re introducing stress to your system, but that stress is a force for good, because it triggers your body to get more efficient at using its resources and your tissues to grow back even stronger. In other words, exercise makes your body — including your brain — more resilient.Exercise benefits several of the root causes of neurological disease.It improves structure by increasing your cardiovascular capacity and boosting circulation, which delivers oxygen and nutrients to the brain.  FOR ALZHEIMER’S PATIENTS, EATING POMEGRANATES COULD HELP ALLEVIATE SYMPTOMS, STUDY SAYS: ‘PROMISING RESULTS’    It reduces stress in multiple ways — by giving you an outlet to blow off steam, by producing feel-good hormones such as endorphins and lowering the stress hormone cortisol, and, depending on what kind of exercise you choose, getting you outside and into nature, which is a well-known stress reliever. It can also be social, and a great way to spend time with friends or even meet new people, which helps address the loneliness and social isolation that The Lancet lists as one of the modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease.  In her new book \"Reversing Alzheimer's: The New Tool Kit to Improve Cognition and Protect Brain Health,\" published by HarperCollins on June 11, Sandison — based in California — offers a step-by-step guide to helping Alzheimer’s patients improve their overall brain health. (HarperCollins)  It improves sleep by tiring you out.It strengthens immune function, which reduces the risk and effects of infection — all those muscular contractions and moving against gravity improves the flow of lymphatic fluid, which delivers immune cells and flushes away invader cells.\"Exercise benefits several of the root causes of neurological disease.\"   It promotes detox, both through increased circulation and through sweating.   It improves signaling, as challenging and strengthening your muscles triggers the release of multiple signaling molecules, known as exerkines, that have demonstrated neuroprotective functions.  \"The overarching reason that exercise is such a powerful health protector is that it is what’s known as a hormetic, or a beneficial stressor,\" Sandison writes in her new book. (Dr. Heather Sandison)If you do only one thing: Change up your current exercise routine in a way that challenges your brain and amps up the intensity.   If you are a devoted walker, find a new route that includes hills or stairs. If you’re open to trying something different, check out a new exercise class that you’ve been meaning to try.              Categories of exercise: some familiar, some cutting-edge    There are four types of exercise that you want to prioritize. Four may sound like a lot, but they are not mutually exclusive. You can combine at least two types of exercise in one session — you can turn strength training into cardio by performing your strength moves in high-intensity intervals, or you can make your cardio dual task by doing something that requires your mental focus while you move.Aerobic exerciseAerobic exercise is what we think of as \"cardio\" — it gets your heart and blood pumping and includes forms of exercise such as walking, jogging, biking, dancing and swimming.  Aerobic exercise strengthens your heart, and what’s good for your heart is also good for your brain, because your heart sends the brain the blood, oxygen, and nutrients that your brain relies on to function.  EXPERIMENTAL ALZHEIMER’S DRUG GETS FDA ADVISORY PANEL'S THUMBS-UP: ‘PROGRESS IS HAPPENING’Your first goal with adding more exercise to your life is to get 150 to 200 minutes of aerobic exercise each week so that you get your heart rate into the vigorous zone of 70-85% of maximum heart rate.     Listening to your body and adjusting your intensity level based on your perceived exertion is one of the best ways to know if you are pushing yourself hard enough.Strength training    Strength training — also known as resistance training — is just what it sounds like: using weights or other forms of resistance to build muscle tissue.  Building muscle — particularly in the big muscle groups of the legs, hips, and torso — is directly related to brain health, because these muscles generate brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a \"fertilizer\" for the brain, cueing it to create new neuronal connections and promoting neuroplasticity.  Alzheimer's patients should aim for at least two strength-training sessions per week, notes the author of a new book.  (iStock)  You want to aim for at least two strength-training sessions per week. Strength training doesn’t have to involve your standard barbells and bench pressing your body weight. You can use resistance bands, light dumbbells, or even the weight of your own body in exercises like squats, lunges and planks. Even climbing stairs or hills counts as strength training and cardio in one activity, because they get your heart rate up as they also keep the muscles of the legs and hips strong.                    Dual-task training    This next-level form of exercise combines physical movement with a cognitive challenge. The simplest form of this is walking and talking.   What is a cognitive challenge will vary from person to person, but if you’re in prevention mode, listening to a foreign language lesson or a nonfiction book while you walk outside or ride the stationary bike, and then pausing the recording to recap what you’ve just learned every few minutes, is a good option. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER                                                                                                   For some people, going to a Pilates or yoga class or other class where you really have to pay attention to the teacher’s cues constitutes dual-task training — but not if it’s something you’ve been doing for long enough that you can zone out. \"Exercise is such a powerful health intervention that if we could just bottle it, we could probably get rid of chronic disease.\"   And if you have already started experiencing measurable cognitive decline, dual-task training may look like going on a walk while pointing out the names of the plants that you pass along the way, or having someone quiz you on the names of family members, or recalling family stories or important dates. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP             Wherever you are, you want to be working right on your edge — you can almost feel the wheels of your brain turning in order to stay focused.Contrast oxygen therapyThis relatively unique form of training alternates the amount of oxygen in the air you breathe as you exercise — an approach that encourages the tiniest blood vessels (known as your microvasculature) throughout your body, including your brain, to open up, resulting in greatly enhanced blood flow.     It’s similar to going to altitude to train and build your aerobic capacity, and it is incredibly valuable for cognitive function.           \"Exercise does take time and effort, but making this one activity a regular part of your life addresses so many causal factors of dementia that it can profoundly reduce your risk,\" Sandison says in her book. (iStock)  This type of exercise does require specialized gear. You can buy the device, or go find a clinic near you where you can try it out. It does require you to wear a mask that is hooked up to a machine while you exercise, and when the oxygen saturation is low, it can be intense because you have to work harder to bring in enough air. In other words, contrast oxygen therapy is not for everyone. But if you are willing and able, it can be dramatically helpful.For more Health articles, visit www.foxnews/health     Honestly, exercise is such a powerful health intervention that if we could just bottle it, we could probably get rid of chronic disease. Exercise does take time and effort, but making this one activity a regular part of your life addresses so many causal factors of dementia that it can profoundly reduce your risk.Excerpted with permission from the new book, \"Reversing Alzheimer's: The New Tool Kit to Improve Cognition and Protect Brain Health\" (HarperCollins) by Dr. Heather Sandison, copyright © 2024 by Dr. Heather Sandison.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says consumers should avoid eating shellfish from Oregon and Washington state as they may be contaminated with toxins that cause paralytic shellfish poisoning. Oregon and Washington have prohibited shellfish harvesting on their coastlines, but shellfish have already been distributed across the country.At least 31 people have been sickened by paralytic shellfish poisoning so far.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says consumers should avoid eating shellfish from Oregon and Washington state as they may be contaminated with toxins that cause paralytic shellfish poisoning. At least 31 people have been sickened in Oregon so far, according to state health officials. Here's what to know about the federal agency's advisory.What did the FDA say about shellfish?    The warning says to avoid oysters and bay clams harvested from Netarts and Tillamook bays in northern Oregon since May 28, as well as shellfish harvested from areas around Willapa Bay in southern Washington since May 26. They may be contaminated with high levels of paralytic shellfish poisoning, or PSP, a naturally occurring toxin produced by algae.Shellfish harvested from those areas during that period were distributed beyond Oregon and Washington to Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Nevada, New York. The FDA has warned restaurants and retailers in those states not to serve it.  MICHIGAN KILLS 31,000 SALMON AFTER THEY CONTRACTED DISEASE AT HATCHERYWhat do we know about the shellfish poisoning outbreak so far?  Elevated levels of toxins were first detected in shellfish on the Oregon coast on May 17, state fish and wildlife officials said.  Since then, a paralytic shellfish poisoning outbreak has sickened at least 31 people in Oregon, according to the Oregon Health Authority. The agency has asked people who have harvested or eaten Oregon shellfish since May 13 to fill out a survey intended to help investigators identify the cause of the outbreak and the number of people sickened.Oregon authorities have closed the state's entire coastline to the harvesting of mussels, razor clams and bay clams. Agriculture officials have also closed three bays, including those named in the FDA advisory, to commercial oyster harvesting.

(AP Photo/Elaine Thompson, File)  Officials in neighboring Washington have also closed the state’s Pacific coastline to the harvesting of shellfish, including mussels, clams, scallops and oysters, a a shellfish safety map produced by the Washington State Department of Health shows.What is paralytic shellfish poisoning?Paralytic shellfish poisoning, or PSP, is caused by saxitoxin, a naturally occurring toxin that’s produced by algae. Saxitoxin is a neurotoxin, meaning it can damage nerve tissue.  People who eat shellfish contaminated with high levels of saxitoxins usually start feeling ill within 30 to 60 minutes, according to Oregon health officials. Symptoms include numbness of the mouth and lips, vomiting, diarrhea, shortness of breath and irregular heartbeat in severe cases.    There is no antidote to PSP, according to the health agency. Treatment for severe cases may require mechanical ventilators to help with breathing.Authorities warn that cooking or freezing contaminated shellfish doesn’t kill the toxins or make it safe to eat.What causes paralytic shellfish poisoning?A \"very large\" algal bloom has resulted in \"unprecedented levels\" of PSP toxins along Oregon's coast, Matthew Hunter, shellfish program manager for the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, said during a briefing.    The toxins have accumulated in the shellfish, sickening some people who have eaten them.While the factors that create harmful algal blooms are not well understood, certain factors — resulting from both natural processes and human activities — are believed to play a role, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\"Studies show that many algal species flourish when wind and water currents are favorable,\" the agency says on a webpage dedicated to explaining harmful algal blooms. Some blooms, it says, stem from \"sluggish water circulation, unusually high water temperatures, and extreme weather events like hurricanes, floods, and drought.\"  Algae growth can also increase when nutrients used in fertilizers, mainly phosphorus and nitrogen, flow into bodies of water, according to the agency.How long will shellfish be unsafe to eat?    Oregon officials said it may take weeks, months or even up to a year for toxin levels to subside, depending on the type of shellfish.Mussels can accumulate paralytic shellfish poison rapidly, but also rid themselves of it quickly, according to Hunter, the Oregon fish and wildlife official. Because of this, it may take anywhere from two weeks to a month for mussels to eliminate the toxin.  Razor clams, however, are slower to do so.

The theft of electric vehicle charging cables is on the rise, possibly fueled by the nearly record-high price of copper. The cables contain copper wiring inside of them that thieves can sell.Cable thefts make it harder for EV manufacturers to convince would-be buyers that a charging station will always be available during their travels, as entire stations are often disabled.Charging companies and police are working on ways to fight back against thieves, like installing more security cameras and visiting recycling centers to look for stolen metal.Just before 2 a.m. on a chilly April night in Seattle, a Chevrolet Silverado pickup stopped at an electric vehicle charging station on the edge of a shopping center parking lot.    Two men, one with a light strapped to his head, got out. A security camera recorded them pulling out bolt cutters. One man snipped several charging cables; the other loaded them into the truck. In under 2½ minutes, they were gone.The scene that night has become part of a troubling pattern across the country: Thieves have been targeting EV charging stations, intent on stealing the cables, which contain copper wiring. The price of copper is near a record high on global markets, which means criminals stand to collect rising sums of cash from selling the material.  AUTO INDUSTRY EXPERTS WARN BIDEN'S EV MANDATE MAY LIMIT GAS CAR OPTIONS IN THE FUTURE  The stolen cables often disable entire stations, forcing EV owners on the road to search desperately for a working charger. For the owners, the predicament can be exasperating and stressful.  Broken-down chargers have emerged as the latest obstacle for U.S. automakers in their strenuous effort to convert more Americans to EVs despite widespread public anxiety about a scarcity of charging stations. About 4 in 10 U.S. adults say they believe EVs take too long to charge or don’t know of any charging stations nearby.If even finding a charging station doesn't necessarily mean finding functioning cables, it becomes one more reason for skeptical buyers to stick with traditional gasoline-fueled or hybrid vehicles, at least for now.  A Tesla supercharging location is seen on Kipling Street on June 3, 2024, in Houston. Charging stations have been hit particularly hard by thieves who likely want to sell the copper wiring inside the cables at near-record prices. (AP Photo/Lekan Oyekanmi)  America's major automakers have made heavy financial bets that buyers will shift away from combustion engines and embrace EVs as they say the world faces the worsening consequences of climate change. Accordingly, the companies have poured billions into EVs.Stellantis envisions 50% of its passenger cars being EVs by the end of 2030. Ford set a target of producing 2 million EVs per year by 2026 — about 45% of its global sales — though it has since suspended that goal. General Motors, the most ambitious of the three, has pledged to sell only EV passenger cars by the end of 2035.  Any such timetables, of course, hinge on whether the companies can convince more would-be EV buyers that a charge will always be available when they travel. The rise in cable thefts isn't likely to strengthen the automakers' case.    Two years ago, according to Electrify America, which runs the nation’s second-largest network of direct-current fast chargers, a cable might be cut perhaps every six months at one of its 968 charging stations, with 4,400 plugs nationwide. Through May this year, the figure reached 129 — four more than in all of 2023. At one Seattle station, cables were cut six times in the past year, said Anthony Lambkin, Electrify America's vice president of operations.\"We’re enabling people to get to work, to take their kids to school, get to medical appointments,\" Lambkin said. \"So to have an entire station that’s offline is pretty impactful to our customers.\"Two other leading EV charging companies — Flo and EVgo — also have reported a rise in thefts. Charging stations in the Seattle area have been a frequent target. Sites in Nevada, California, Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas and Pennsylvania have been hit, too.    Stations run by Tesla, which operates the nation's largest fast-charging network, have been struck in Seattle, Oakland and Houston. So far this year, Seattle police have reported seven cases of cable thefts from charging stations, matching the number for all of 2023. Thieves hit Tesla stations four times this year compared with just once last year, the Seattle police said.\"Vandalism of public charging infrastructure in the Seattle metro area has unfortunately been increasing in frequency,\" EVgo said.The company said law enforcement officials are investigating the thefts while it tries to repair inoperable stations and considers a longer-term solution.  The problem isn't confined to urban areas. In rural Sumner, Washington, about 30 miles south of Seattle, thieves cut cables twice at a Puget Sound Energy charging station. The company is working with police and the property owner to protect the station, which cost more than $500,000 to install.    Until a month ago, police in Houston knew of no cable thefts. Then one was stolen from a charger at a gas station. The city has now recorded eight or nine such thefts, said Sgt. Robert Carson, who leads a police metal-theft unit.In one case, thieves swiped 18 of 19 cords at a Tesla station. That day, Carson visited the station to inspect the damage. In the first five minutes that he was there, Carson said, about 10 EVs that needed charging had to be turned away.  In very large cities like Houston, charging stations typically contain an especially large number of plugs and cables, so thefts can be particularly damaging.\"They're not just taking one,\" Carson said. \"When they're hit, they're hit pretty hard.\"  Roy Manuel, an Uber driver who normally recharges his Tesla at the Houston station hit by thieves, said he fears being unable to do so because of stolen cables.  \"If my battery was really low, I’d have quite an issue with operating my vehicle,\" he said. \"If it was so low that I couldn’t get to another charger, I might be in trouble. Might even need a tow truck.\"The charging companies say it's become clear that the thieves are after the copper that the cables contain. In late May, copper hit a record high of nearly $5.20 a pound, a result, in part, of rising demand resulting from efforts to cut carbon emissions with EVs that use more copper wiring. The price is up about 25% from a year ago, and many analysts envision further increases.  Charging companies say there isn't actually very much copper in the cables, and what copper is there is difficult to extract. Carson estimates that criminals can get $15 to $20 per cable at a scrap yard.    \"They're not making a significant amount of money,\" he said. \"They're not going to be sailing on a yacht anywhere.\"Still, the more cables the thieves can steal, the more they can cash in. At $20 a cable, 20 stolen cables could fetch them $400.The problem for the charging companies is that it's much costlier to replace cables. In Minneapolis, where cables have been clipped at city-owned charging stations, sometimes multiple times, it costs about $1,000 to replace just one cable, said Joe Laurin, project manager in the Department of Public Works.  The charging companies are working on strategies to fight back. Electrify America is installing more security cameras. In Houston, police are visiting recycling centers to look for stolen metal.  But it's often hard for the scrap yards to determine conclusively whether metal came from a charging cable. Thieves often burn off the insulation and just sell strands of metal.The Recycled Materials Association, which represents 1,700 members, is issuing scrap-theft alerts from law enforcement officials so that members can be on the lookout for suspects and stolen goods.    Carson urged EV owners to watch for suspicious people near chargers and to call police.\"If people are driving down the road and you see a gas-powered vehicle, a truck, at a charging station, that probably doesn't belong there,\" he said.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Because charging stations are often situated in remote corners of parking lots, Carson suggested that many more security cameras are needed.In the meantime, Electrify America said Seattle police are trying to track down the thieves in the video. And Carson said the Houston police are pursuing leads in the Tesla theft.\"We'd like to get them stopped,\" he said, \"and then let the court system do what they're supposed to do.\"\n","close      Video Nicole Brown Simpson's sisters recall O.J.

The decision to televise O.J. Simpson's infamous 1995 trial for the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman rocketed the \"Dream Team,\" his group of star-studded defense attorneys, into household names that continued to represent high-profile clients. Thirty years after Brown and Goldman's deaths on June 12, 1994, here is where Simpson's team and key legal figures in the case are today.Johnnie Cochran    Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., who took over as the head of Simpson's defense team, famously told jurors \"If it doesn't fit, you must acquit,\" suggesting that the bloody gloves that were found at the crime scene were too small to fit the former football star. \"I’ve got to say I don’t think I’d be home today without Johnnie,\" Simpson said after his criminal trial, according to The Seattle Times. \"I was innocent, but he believed it.\"  Cochran would expand his law firm into 15 states, frequently appeared on television after the 1995 Los Angeles trial and became the inspiration for Jackie Chiles, Kramer's bombastic lawyer on the hit '90s sitcom \"Seinfeld.\"  'THE LIFE & MURDER OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON': FAMILY AND FRIENDS SHED LIGHT ON INFAMOUS CASE IN NEW DOCUMENTARY  Attorney Johnnie Cochran poses for a photo on Dec. 1, 1996.

In 2005, Shapiro created a foundation that grants college scholarships to 11- to 18-year-olds for staying sober in honor of his 24-year-old son, who died of an overdose. He also penned \"Somo Says No,\" a children's book with an anti-drug theme.     Shapiro is the co-founder of LegalZoom, ShoeDazzle and Rightcounsel.com. Last year, he was recognized as one of the \"500 Leading Lawyers in America\" by LawDragon. Barry ScheckBarry Scheck was the attorney who introduced DNA science to jurors, undermining the prosecution's forensic evidence by attacking collection methods of evidence at the scene.  Scheck argued that all the DNA from the evidence samples were degraded because swatches were stored in plastic, not paper, bags and then left in an LAPD van without refrigeration for up to seven hours. He argued that those samples were later cross-contaminated with DNA from Brown Simpson and Goldman's reference vials. In 1992, Scheck and fellow defense lawyer Peter Neufeld co-founded the Innocence Project, which uses DNA evidence to exonerate people who are wrongly convicted. By 2020, the project had exonerated 375 wrongfully convicted individuals, according to the initiative's website.  The O.J.

He had handled shares in Biochem Pharma owned by his former client, marijuana trafficker Claude Duboc, CBS reported. He transferred a large portion of Duboc's assets, including stocks valued at $5.9 million, into his own accounts – that money had been earmarked for the forfeiture of assets that Duboc agreed upon in his plea bargain.Alan DershowitzAlan Dershowitz, a Harvard law professor emeritus, helped get Simpson acquitted and was consulted on the scientific aspects of his murder case. Since then, he helped late hedge fund manager and child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein win a lenient sentence in his 2008 trial for repeatedly soliciting sex from teenage girls.  Dershowitz negotiated a controversial non-prosecution agreement on Epstein's behalf – he would later plead guilty to one state charge of procuring prostitution from a girl under 18 and was sentenced to just 18 months in prison.   In 2011, Dershowitz served as a consultant on a legal team for Julian Assange, who was facing charges from the U.S. government for distributing classified documents through Wikileaks.

Steve Bannon, a longtime ally of former President Trump, filed an emergency motion on Tuesday seeking to keep him out of prison as he pursues an appeal – possibly to the U.S. Supreme Court – on his conviction for defying a Jan. 6 House committee subpoena.     The motion filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia requests a ruling by June 18 – before Bannon’s surrender date of July 1 – to allow sufficient time to seek further relief from the Supreme Court if necessary. Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington agreed to the Justice Department's request to require that Bannon report to prison on July 1 after a federal appeals court panel in May upheld his contempt of Congress conviction.\"There is also no denying the political realities here. Mr. Bannon is a high-profile political commentator and campaign strategist. He was prosecuted by an administration whose policies are a frequent target of Mr. Bannon’s public statements,\" the motion says. \"The government seeks to imprison Mr. Bannon for the four-month period leading up to the November election, when millions of Americans look to him for information on important campaign issues. This would also effectively bar Mr. Bannon from serving as a meaningful advisor in the ongoing national campaign.\"  \"This is a landmark case. The prosecution pursued a novel and aggressive theory of liability, and the case garnered international attention,\" Bannon’s lawyer, R. Trent McCotter, wrote. \"If the panel decision stands, there will be far-reaching consequences, including separation-of-powers concerns. Before the prosecution of Mr. Bannon, it had been 50 years since the government convinced a jury to convict someone for not adequately responding to a congressional subpoena—and there has certainly been no shortage of disputes over congressional subpoenas during that time.\"  JUDGE ORDERS STEVE BANNON TO REPORT TO PRISON  Steve Bannon, former adviser to former President Trump, center, and attorney Matthew Evan Corcoran, left, depart the courthouse on June 6, 2024 in Washington, D.C. (Kent Nishimura/Getty Images)  Bannon was convicted nearly two years ago of two counts of contempt of Congress: one for refusing to sit for a deposition with the Jan. 6 House Committee and the other for refusing to provide documents related to his involvement in Trump’s efforts to have the 2020 presidential election results showing a victory for President Biden overturned. Nichols, nominated by Trump to the bench in 2018, had initially allowed Bannon to remain free while he fought his conviction because the judge believed the case raised substantial legal questions. However, during a hearing in Washington's federal court, Nichols said the calculus changed after a three-judge District of Columbia appeals court panel said all of Bannon’s challenges lack merit.  The motion Tuesday comes after Trump was convicted on 34 felony charges in his New York City hush money trial and faces a sentencing hearing next month just four days before the Republican National Convention, where the GOP will likely declare him their official 2024 presidential nominee.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY, Calif. – Many parents and grandparents who spoke with Fox News have a dismal view of the American dream, saying they worry it’s \"dying\" or already dead for the next generation.    \"They can't afford the American dream,\" Pat from Gilroy, California, said. \"What we wanted when we were young, it's not something our kids can afford.\"  Many people visiting Coronado, California, in late March 2024 told Fox News they worried the American dream was dead or dying.

Sojourner Truth  Sojourner Truth was born in 1797 under the name Isabella Baumfree, in Ulster County, New York – where slavery was still legal at the time. She escaped to freedom in 1826 with her infant daughter after her owner refused to comply with the gradual abolition of slavery law New York had passed, the National Parks Service reports.   Baumfree later freed her son, who had been sold to an Alabama slave owner, by bringing her case to court.     TARGET PULLS BLACK HISTORY MONTH PRODUCT FROM SHELVES THAT MIXED UP THREE CIVIL RIGHTS ICONSBy 1828, she became the first Black woman to win a case against a former slave owner.Almost two decades later, Baumfree joined a Methodist church and changed her name to Sojourner Truth as she traveled the country to promote the abolition of slavery, the advancement of women’s rights, and religious tolerance.     Baumfree famously delivered her \"Ain’t I a Woman?\" speech in 1851 at the Ohio Women’s Rights Convention and met President Lincoln in 1864 through her work for the National Freedmen’s Relief Association. She also dictated a group of memoirs that were published in her book \"The Narrative of Sojourner Truth: a Northern Slave\" (1850).2.

(MPI/Getty Images)  Harriet Tubman, conductor of the Underground Railroad and a Union Army spy, was born in March 1822 in Dorchester County, Maryland, under the name Araminta Ross. She changed her name in 1844 following her marriage to John Tubman, a free man, the National Parks Service reports. About five years after her marriage, Tubman escaped to freedom in Philadelphia, where slavery was abolished.   Tubman spent the next decade of her life rescuing family and friends in what is now known as the Underground Railroad. Tubman served as an instrumental spy for the Union Army.   She personally made \"about 13 trips into Maryland\" to free her companions and provided a map to freedom to \"about 70 more,\" according to the NPS. When the Civil War broke out in the 1860s, Tubman served as an instrumental spy for the Union Army.

Ida B. WellsAmerican journalist and civil rights advocate Ida B. Wells was born in Holly Springs, Mississippi, on July 16, 1862, five months and two weeks before the delivery of the Emancipation Proclamation.     Wells moved to Tennessee and became a teacher in adulthood. Wells began to write political articles after she won a lawsuit against the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad in 1887 for being forcibly removed from a first-class train car she paid for; that decision was ultimately overturned by the Tennessee Supreme Court, Mississippi History reports.Wells later moved to Chicago and took on a leadership role at the NAACP. Wells went on to write exposés about school segregation and lynching in Memphis until she was forced to move to New York City for her safety. She continued her investigative reports about disparities in the American education system under segregation, mistreatment that African Americans experienced, and the road to women’s suffrage.   Some of her famous written works include \"Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases\" (1893) and \"Mob Rule in New Orleans\" (1900).   Wells later moved to Chicago and took on a leadership role at the NAACP. She also ran for the Illinois legislature before her death in 1931.6. W. E. B. Du BoisAmerican sociologist and historian William Edward Burghardt Du Bois was born on Feb. 23, 1868, in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. Du Bois was the first Black graduate of Searles High School in 1884 and later earned his bachelor of arts from Fisk University in Tennessee, America’s Library reports.     MEET THE AMERICAN WHO GAVE BIRTH TO THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT, ALBERTA KING, ‘GAVE HER ALL FOR CHRIST’  He then earned a second bachelor’s degree, a master's and a doctorate in history from Harvard University.

The NAACP characterizes itself as a grassroots organization that \"builds Black political power to end structural racism.\"7. Thurgood Marshall  Thurgood Marshall, the great-grandson of a slave, was the first Black justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. (Getty Images)Thurgood Marshall, the first African American appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court, was born on July 2, 1908, in Baltimore.   He was formerly named Thoroughgood Marshall, but he legally changed his name at the age of 6. Marshall later became interested in the law as a high school student after he was ordered to read the U.S. Constitution as a punishment for a prank he pulled, United States Courts reports. From that moment, he was inspired to become a lawyer after he realized not all African Americans were able to enjoy the liberties laid out in the Bill of Rights.    10 FACTS ABOUT BLACK HISTORY MONTH THAT ARE WELL WORTH KNOWING DURING OBSERVANCES IN FEBRUARY  Marshall attended Lincoln University and then Howard University School of Law, where he worked with the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund. Around 1935, Marshall found counterarguments for segregation when he reviewed the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which stated facilities could be divided by race if they were \"separate but equal.\" Marshall found this doctrine flawed and created discrepancies in the education children received, which led him to take on and win several landmark cases. His most famous case that changed the American school system was Brown v. Board of Education (1954), which declared that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional.    President John F. Kennedy appointed Marshall as a federal judge to the U.S. Court of Appeals in 1961. Four years later, Marshall was appointed as solicitor general by President Lyndon Johnson. By 1967, Johnson appointed Marshall to the Supreme Court – where he served as a justice until 1991.8. Rosa Parks   Rosa Parks, civil rights activist, was born in 1913 in Tuskegee, Alabama.

She married her husband, Raymond Parks in 1932 and worked as a seamstress before she became a member of the Montgomery National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the National Parks Service reports.At age 42, Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat at the front of a bus to a White passenger and move to the back, a practice that wasn’t uncommon during the time of Jim Crow.     The arrest inspired 17,000 African Americans to start the Montgomery Bus Boycott, which lasted for 13 months and hurt the city bus service’s revenue. Parks remained a symbol of resilience during this time.   The boycott finally came to an end in 1956 when the Supreme Court ruled that segregated buses were unconstitutional. Parks moved to Detroit a year later, working with the NAACP and Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., to fight homelessness, and even created a job training institute.She earned a Congressional Gold Medal in 1991.9. Shirley Chisholm   Shirley Chisholm, the first African American woman to serve in the United States Congress, was born in Brooklyn, New York, on Nov. 30, 1924, under the name Shirley Anita St. Hill. In her youth, Chisholm was partially raised by her grandparents in Barbados before her family settled in Brooklyn, the U.S. House of Representatives reports.   Chisholm earned a bachelor's degree in sociology from Brooklyn College and a master's in elementary education from Columbia University.

Chisholm was elected to the New York state legislature in 1964 and then the U.S. House of Representatives in 1968, when she represented Brooklyn’s Bedford-Stuyvesant district for seven terms.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was born in 1929 in Atlanta, Georgia. (Getty Images)  Civil rights leader Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was born on Jan. 15, 1929, in Atlanta. Post-college, King dedicated his life to fighting racial inequality with peaceful resistance to unjust laws. He notably protested segregation in public schools, restaurants and hotels with nonviolent sit-ins, America’s Library reports. King also delivered moving speeches that challenged the mistreatment that African Americans faced under Jim Crow laws and called for equality. King delivered his most famous speech, \"I Have a Dream,\" on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial during the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.King's notable accomplishments during the Civil Rights Movement (1954-1968) included the Montgomery Bus Boycott; pleading for peace when U.S. marshals were called in to disperse the Freedom Riders (segregation protesters riding on interracial buses) in Montgomery; and leading the Voting Rights March from Selma to Montgomery, which was met with violent resistance.   However, it showed the world the assaults that African Americans faced during peaceful protests through photos and video.11.

In 1999, she established The Ruby Bridges Foundation to create change in education and a more inclusive society. In 2001, she was awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal by President Bill Clinton.12. Claudette Colvin Claudette Colvin has a story similar to one often heard about Rosa Parks, although it happened nine months prior. On March 2, 1955, when Colvin was 15 years old, she was riding the bus when the driver told her to give up her seat and move to the back.  Colvin refused, expressing that she paid for her ticket, and it was her constitutional right to be in the seat she was in. Colvin was put in handcuffs and taken off the bus by two police officers for her refusal to give up her seat. Colvin was one of the four plaintiffs who were part of the case Browder v. Gayle. This case ruled Montgomery’s segregated bus system unconstitutional. 13. Jackie Robinson   Jackie Robinson was born on Jan. 31, 1919, in Cairo, Georgia.

Martin Luther King Jr., who spent his life fighting American injustice, was born Jan. 15, 1929, and his birthday, which was made a federal holiday late in 1983, is celebrated every year on the third Monday in January.    From King's opposition to war and dedication to eradicating poverty to the relentless fight against segregation, his influence echoes through history, inspiring generations toward justice, equality and social change.Explore King's profound journey as we unravel the lesser-known facets of his legacy.WarPovertySegregationVotingLegacy  MARTIN LUTHER KING JR: THE LIFE AND THE LEGACY  1. War  The idealization of King and the years following his assassination have obscured the radical nature of his vision. Toward the end of his life, the civil rights leader criticized the Vietnam War and the disparities in the American economy.  King had come to the conclusion that both militarism and poverty were hindering the U.S. from fulfilling its ideals.\"I oppose the war in Vietnam because I love America,\" King told an audience at New York’s Riverside Church in 1967. \"I speak out against this war, not in anger, but with anxiety and sorrow in my heart, and, above all, with a passionate desire to see our beloved country stand as the moral example of the world.\"  The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was a prominent leader in the American civil rights movement. (Walter Bennett/The LIFE Picture Collection via Getty Images)2. Poverty  During the spring of 1968, King achieved successes in the realms of desegregation and voting rights. While strategizing his Poor People’s Campaign, he shifted his focus to Memphis, the rugged city in Tennessee along the Mississippi River. Advocating for the rights of striking sanitation workers, King aimed to organize marches, illustrating the effectiveness of nonviolent protest.At the age of 39, the pioneer of nonviolence in the American civil rights movement met his tragic end on the evening of April 4, 1968, in Memphis. He was shot and killed by James Earl Ray, who was later captured in the UK. By then, King had already emerged as one of the most globally recognized figures.  The next day, King’s closest confidant, the Rev. Ralph David Abernathy, said, \"Tighten your belts and dry your tears. If you love Martin Luther King as you say you do, help me carry on his work.\"    MARTIN LUTHER KING JR’S ‘DREAM’ FOR A BETTER AMERICA HAD ROOTS IN THE HEBREW BIBLEThe members of King’s tight circle barely paused to grieve. They plunged into carrying out his unfinished work and turned it into a lifelong vow.Several entered the political arena while a handful persisted in contributing to the organization King spearheaded or initiated their own ventures. Others returned to the pulpit, advocating a gospel of racial liberation.3. Segregation    King fought for many progressive issues throughout his life as a monist er and the leader of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, speaking out against various systemic barriers holding back Blacks, Hispanics, Asian Americans and Native Americans.  King fought for many progressive issues throughout his life as a minister and the leader of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, speaking out against various systemic barriers that held back Blacks, Hispanics, Asian Americans and Native Americans. (Howard Sochurek/The LIFE Picture Collection via Getty Images)He famously delivered his \"I Have a Dream\" speech during the 1963 March on Washington, calling for equality among the races.King played a pivotal role in orchestrating the Montgomery bus boycott in 1955 after Rosa Parks' arrest for declining to surrender her seat on a city bus.   Just four days after Parks' arrest in Montgomery, Alabama, King passionately encouraged a gathering at Holt Street Baptist Church to initiate a bus boycott.    \"Now let us go out to stick together and stay with this thing until the end,\" he told the thousands gathered at the church that day in 1955.ALVEDA KING SAYS OF MLK'S ICONIC SPEECH, 57 YEARS LATER: 'WE STILL HAVE A DREAM'   A federal court ended racial segregation on Montgomery public buses, elevating King into the national spotlight.Years later, he stood behind President Lyndon Johnson at the signing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned segregation in public places and employment discrimination on the basis of race or national origin.4. Voting  King advocated for the passage of federal civil rights laws, which were ultimately implemented, earning him the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of his impactful contributions.  King's involvement in the 54-mile march from Selma, Alabama, to the state capital of Montgomery raised awareness about the challenges faced by Black individuals in their efforts to register to vote.  King played a key role in significant events, including the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the March on Washington. His famous \"I Have a Dream\" speech remains iconic in the fight against racial discrimination. (PA Images via Getty Images)Following attacks on marchers by White mobs and police, Johnson delivered a compelling address in a special session of Congress, effectively persuading lawmakers to pass the Voting Rights Act.  King left a lasting impact. In the 1970s and 1980s, the American South witnessed the election of thousands of Black individuals to various offices, a stark contrast to the nearly nonexistent representation in the 1950s.    Coalitions of Black and Latino communities emerged in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and Houston, working together to elect individuals of color to both local and federal offices. Eventually, these efforts played a role in the election of the nation's first Black president.5. LegacyAs King approached the end of his life, his progressivism took on a more radical stance, leading to an intensification of backlash against him.MARTIN LUTHER KING JR DAY MUST BE FOR ALL OF US  \"We have fought hard and long for integration, as I believe we should have, and I know that we will win. But I've come to believe we're integrating into a burning house,\" King said. \"I'm afraid that America may be losing what moral vision she may have had. …. And I'm afraid that even as we integrate, we are walking into a place that does not understand that this nation needs to be deeply concerned with the plight of the poor and disenfranchised. Until we commit ourselves to ensuring that the underclass is given justice and opportunity, we will continue to perpetuate the anger and violence that tears at the soul of this nation.\"  In a Gallup poll from 1966, 63% of the American public held a negative opinion of King. According to an early Harris Poll from 1968, the iconic leader died with a public disapproval rating reaching nearly 75%. Following King's assassination, 31% of Americans told Gallup that they believed he \"brought it on himself.\"CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP     While the leader favored the influence of morality over the allure of popularity, the latter has grown throughout the years, giving credence to his statement: \"The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.\"King’s example, and his insistence on nonviolent protest, continues to influence many activists pushing for civil rights and social change.  The legacy of service and political empowerment left by King has inspired generations to advocate for political and social reforms aligned with his principles of pacifism and unity.\n","close      Video All-American made toys companies on display in FOX Square American-based toy companies showcase their products on 'Fox & Friends.'

Authorities say commercial shipping traffic through the Port of Baltimore will soon return to normal levels since the waterway fully reopened earlier this week for the first time since the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse.Officials estimate the salvage operations will cost up to $75 million, and rebuilding the bridge could cost nearly $2 billion.The exact causes of the electrical issues that caused the cargo ship Dali to lose power and crash into the bridge have yet to be determined.Authorities anticipate commercial shipping traffic through the Port of Baltimore will soon return to normal levels since the channel fully reopened earlier this week for the first time since the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse.    \"They are back open for business, ready to bring in the largest container ships that call there,\" U.S. Coast Guard Rear Admiral Shannon Gilreath said during a virtual press briefing Tuesday afternoon.Some shipping companies rerouted their cargo to other ports following the deadly bridge collapse in March. The disaster halted most maritime traffic through Baltimore’s busy port as crews worked around the clock to clear an estimated 50,000 tons of fallen steel and concrete from the Patapsco River — a roughly $100 million effort that involved federal, state and local agencies, officials said.  COAST GUARD STUDYING IF OTHER BRIDGES AT RISK FOLLOWING BALTIMORE BRIDGE DISASTER  Companies that steered clear of Baltimore during the cleanup efforts will likely come back now that the channel has been returned to its original depth and width, officials said. The city’s port processes more cars and farm equipment than any other in the country.  All that rerouted commercial traffic \"belongs in Baltimore today,\" U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said. \"We have every indication that that is what is taking place, but we will be reinforcing that expectation as we speak with players up and down the supply chains.\"Crews were able to reopen portions of the deep-draft channel in phases, restoring some commercial traffic in recent weeks. Some cruise ships and large container ships have already passed through, officials said.  Salvage crews continue to clean up wreckage from the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in the Patapsco River on June 11, 2024, in Baltimore, Maryland. Baltimore's Fort McHenry Federal Channel has fully opened for shipping traffic months after the cargo ship Dali collided with the bridge, causing it to collapse. (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)  But thousands of longshoremen, truckers and small business owners have seen their jobs impacted by the collapse and its economic ripple effects, which extend well beyond the Baltimore region.Officials estimated the salvage operations will cost up to $75 million, while the Coast Guard response has cost $24 million to date.  Rebuilding the bridge could cost nearly $2 billion, officials have said. They hope it’s completed by 2028.    The Biden administration approved $60 million in immediate federal aid, which Buttigieg referred to as \"a down payment on the work ahead.\" All of that aid has been committed, said White House Deputy Chief of Staff Natalie Quillian.President Joe Biden has pledged that the federal government will cover the full cost of rebuilding the bridge, though officials said the funding is still awaiting approval from Congress.In a statement Tuesday, Biden praised the work of everyone involved in the recovery effort to date.    \"Baltimore can count on us to stick with them every step of the way, and we will continue to have your back until the bridge is rebuilt,\" he said.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe cargo ship Dali crashed into a critical support column of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in the early hours of March 26, collapsing the span and sending six members of a roadwork crew plunging to their deaths. The ship had lost power shortly after leaving Baltimore for Sri Lanka. A National Transportation Safety Board investigation found it experienced power outages before starting its voyage, but the exact causes of the electrical issues have yet to be determined. The FBI is also conducting a criminal investigation into the circumstances leading up to the collapse.  The Dali remained stuck amid the wreckage for almost two months, with a massive steel truss draped across its damaged bow. On May 20, the ship was refloated and guided back to port. That allowed officials to open a channel that was 50 feet deep and 400 feet wide, big enough for most of the largest commercial vessels.    The full federal shipping channel is 700 feet wide. Officials said two-way traffic can resume now that it has reopened. They said additional safety requirements have also been lifted because of the increased width.\n","close      Video Navy veteran and injured NYPD cop runs marathons for nonprofit Paws of War Retired detective and Navy vet John Barnett shares how he's running a marathon in every U.S. state to help other veterans and first responders in need of support.

(Paws of War)After the incident, Barnett noticed a sign outside Paws of War’s headquarters in Nesconset, New York, located less than half a mile from his house.    The sign mentioned that the organization helps America's veterans and first responders.\"This is just my way of giving back and helping other first responders, brothers and sisters.\" \"And I said, ‘Oh, well, I need to go in there, because I need help, and I'm a first responder — and a veteran,\" he said. \"So, I went in and they helped me out.\"Since then, Barnett said Paws of War has offered him \"numerous\" services, including veteran training for his two dogs, counseling and \"camaraderie\" within a community of other veterans.  Barnett has two service dogs, a German weimaraner and a German shorthaired pointer, both pictured here. (Paws of War)  While Barnett has always been an avid runner and has completed more than 30 marathons, the veteran decided to run for Paws of War to increase others' awareness of the nonprofit and its good works.    \"This is just my way of giving back and helping other first responders, brothers and sisters,\" he told Fox News Digital.\"Everyone who goes through Paws of War has struggles, and if I can help one person, I feel good.\"  US NAVY SAILOR LAUNCHES RESCUE OF SMALL PUPPY SAVED DURING OVERSEAS DEPLOYMENT: ‘CAN’T LEAVE A COMRADE BEHIND'Barnett emphasized that the organization has helped him \"significantly\" through its various services.  \"I would love for other first responders and veterans to receive the same help that I got from Paws of War,\" he said. \"By running, I can help others … This is my main goal.

In total, 305 people fleeing the Bahamas and Haiti were busted for unlawful maritime migration attempts during Operation Vigilant Sentry and rescued from unsafe vessels and returned to their countries. The major operation last week came on the heels of President Biden's controversial and hotly debated immigration policy, enacted June 4, that bars asylum for migrants who illegally enter the U.S. by land or sea.   \"Irregular maritime migration is unlawful and extremely dangerous,\" Coast Guard Enforcement Officer Lt.

There wasn’t any indications here. No sign of any mental distress.

A magistrate at Rocky River Municipal Court then referred her to a mental health evaluation following her behavior in the courtroom, but Judge Brian Hagan told Fox 8 the organization doing those had nobody available and Ellis would have had to sit in jail for days on a minor offense.   OHIO SUSPECT ACCUSED OF KILLING TODDLER OUTSIDE GIANT EAGLE SMIRKS IN COURT AS DAD LOOKS ON   Bionca Ellis, 32, center right, appears in the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas court, on Monday, June 10.

The decision to televise O.J. Simpson's infamous 1995 trial for the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman rocketed the \"Dream Team,\" his group of star-studded defense attorneys, into household names that continued to represent high-profile clients. Thirty years after Brown and Goldman's deaths on June 12, 1994, here is where Simpson's team and key legal figures in the case are today.Johnnie Cochran    Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., who took over as the head of Simpson's defense team, famously told jurors \"If it doesn't fit, you must acquit,\" suggesting that the bloody gloves that were found at the crime scene were too small to fit the former football star. \"I’ve got to say I don’t think I’d be home today without Johnnie,\" Simpson said after his criminal trial, according to The Seattle Times. \"I was innocent, but he believed it.\"  Cochran would expand his law firm into 15 states, frequently appeared on television after the 1995 Los Angeles trial and became the inspiration for Jackie Chiles, Kramer's bombastic lawyer on the hit '90s sitcom \"Seinfeld.\"  'THE LIFE & MURDER OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON': FAMILY AND FRIENDS SHED LIGHT ON INFAMOUS CASE IN NEW DOCUMENTARY  Attorney Johnnie Cochran poses for a photo on Dec. 1, 1996. (Sion Touhig/Sygma/Sygma via Getty Images)  He would go on to represent Sean \"Diddy\" Combs – the rapper was acquitted on charges of bribery and stolen weapons in 2002, The Seattle Times reported. He also represented Michael Jackson when he was accused of child molestation in 1993 – that case was settled outside of court, and Jackson's family consulted Cochran when the pop legend was accused of molesting another child in 2004.In 2005, Cochran died of brain cancer at 67, the Los Angeles Times reported. Robert Kardashian  Robert Kardashian, who met O.J. Simpson when the two attended college at the University of Southern California together around 1967, renewed his law license to represent his old friend at trial. Simpson stayed at Kardashian's home between the time of Brown Simpson and Goldman's murders and his arrest. Becoming a legal assistant on Simpson's team exempted Kardashian from being subpoenaed to testify at Simpson's trial.NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S SIBLINGS LOOK BACK ON OJ SIMPSON VERDICT: 'I WAS JUST NUMB'  Robert Kardashian, a close friend of O.J.

Kardashian died of esophageal cancer in 2003 at age 59 – since, his fame has been eclipsed by his ex-wife Kris and his children Kourtney, Kim, Khloe and Rob, thanks to their reality show \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians.\" Robert ShapiroRobert Shapiro, the first member and initial chair of Simpson's defense team, continues to practice law. Before Simpson's trial, Shapiro famously represented brothers Lyle and Erik Menendez, who murdered their parents in 1989. He has also represented Darryl Strawberry, Jose Canseco and Vince Coleman, The Associated Press reported.     Shapiro would criticize his fellow \"Dream Team\" lawyers after Simpson's trial, saying that Cochran shouldn't have brought race into the trial and calling F. Lee Bailey a \"loose cannon\" in his book \"The Search for Justice: A Defense Attorney's Brief on the O.J. Simpson Case.\"NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON WAS LIVING IN FEAR OF OJ BEFORE HER MURDER, SISTERS SAY  Robert Shapiro appears in court alongside his client, O.J. Simpson, in Los Angeles, on June 20, 1994. (Ted Soqui/Sygma via Getty Images)Shapiro has also said he doesn't believe Simpson was framed by the Los Angeles Police Department, but does believe that Simpson's verdict was rendered correctly due to reasonable doubt, according to a 2008 interview with USA Today.  In 2005, Shapiro created a foundation that grants college scholarships to 11- to 18-year-olds for staying sober in honor of his 24-year-old son, who died of an overdose. He also penned \"Somo Says No,\" a children's book with an anti-drug theme.     Shapiro is the co-founder of LegalZoom, ShoeDazzle and Rightcounsel.com. Last year, he was recognized as one of the \"500 Leading Lawyers in America\" by LawDragon. Barry ScheckBarry Scheck was the attorney who introduced DNA science to jurors, undermining the prosecution's forensic evidence by attacking collection methods of evidence at the scene.  Scheck argued that all the DNA from the evidence samples were degraded because swatches were stored in plastic, not paper, bags and then left in an LAPD van without refrigeration for up to seven hours. He argued that those samples were later cross-contaminated with DNA from Brown Simpson and Goldman's reference vials. In 1992, Scheck and fellow defense lawyer Peter Neufeld co-founded the Innocence Project, which uses DNA evidence to exonerate people who are wrongly convicted. By 2020, the project had exonerated 375 wrongfully convicted individuals, according to the initiative's website.  The O.J.

Cardozo School of Law, according to the school's website.   He is a commissioner on New York's Forensic Science Review Board, is the first vice president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and served on the board of the National Commission of Justice's Commission on the Future of DNA Evidence, according to his profile on the school's site.F. Lee BaileyFrancis Lee Bailey, better known as F. Lee Bailey, died in 2021 after a long bout in hospice care with an unspecified illness – he was weeks away from his 88th birthday, The New York Times reported.   In addition to Simpson's case, the lawyer known for his courtroom theatrics represented Patricia Hearst, a newspaper heiress who was involved in several armed robberies after she was kidnapped by the Symbionese Liberation Army, the army commander at the My Lai massacre in Vietnam and other infamous cases.

He had handled shares in Biochem Pharma owned by his former client, marijuana trafficker Claude Duboc, CBS reported. He transferred a large portion of Duboc's assets, including stocks valued at $5.9 million, into his own accounts – that money had been earmarked for the forfeiture of assets that Duboc agreed upon in his plea bargain.Alan DershowitzAlan Dershowitz, a Harvard law professor emeritus, helped get Simpson acquitted and was consulted on the scientific aspects of his murder case. Since then, he helped late hedge fund manager and child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein win a lenient sentence in his 2008 trial for repeatedly soliciting sex from teenage girls.  Dershowitz negotiated a controversial non-prosecution agreement on Epstein's behalf – he would later plead guilty to one state charge of procuring prostitution from a girl under 18 and was sentenced to just 18 months in prison.   In 2011, Dershowitz served as a consultant on a legal team for Julian Assange, who was facing charges from the U.S. government for distributing classified documents through Wikileaks. Dershowitz was also a consultant in Harvey Weinstein's trial.

Dershowitz currently has two grandchildren in college, according to his author bio on the Harvard law website.Marcia ClarkMarcia Clark, the lead prosecutor in the trial against Simpson, took a break from law after the trial, People reported. She has appeared frequently as a TV commentator in high-profile trials, and was paid $4 million for her 2006 memoir, \"Without a Doubt,\" according to The Associated Press. The bestselling author has gone on to write nine legal thrillers, according to her website, and has contributed true crime articles to The Daily Beast.  Prosecutor Marcia Clark appears in court during O.J. Simpson’s murder trial in Los Angeles, on July 6, 1994. (Ted Soqui/Sygma via Getty Images)Chris Darden  Co-prosecutor Chris Darden was criticized for having Simpson try on bloody leather gloves found at the crime scene in the courtroom without first ensuring they would fit the former football player, giving credence to Cochran's infamous \"If the gloves don't fit, you must acquit\" slogan.   Darden also resigned from his job with the district attorney's office after Simpson's trial, according to an interview with the Huffington Post, and joined the faculty of the Southwestern University School of Law. After the trial, Darden often appeared as a legal commentator on CNBC, CNN, Court TV and NBC. In 1999, Darden started his own firm, Darden and Associates Inc. He was considered for a judgeship by California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2007, the Metropolitan News Enterprise reported. In a 2012 interview with NBC News, the former prosecutor accused Cochran of \"manipulating\" the infamous gloves, a claim that Dershowitz called \"a total fabrication.\"    Darden represented Eric Ronald Holder Jr., the man accused of murdering rapper Nipsey Hussle, in 2019, according to CBS Los Angeles. After receiving death threats for representing Holder, he dropped the case after entering a not guilty plea on Holder's behalf, the Los Angeles Times reported.  Darden also briefly represented Corey Walker, the alleged killer of rapper Pop Smoke, Essence reported.  Prosecutor Christopher Darden appears in court during O.J.

Pew Research Center released its \"Cultural Issues and the 2024 Election\" report this month, asking 8,709 adults, including 7,166 registered voters, about a wide range of cultural issues including marriage, gender, race, immigration and gun rights.Trump supporters were three times more likely than Biden supporters to say society is better off if people prioritize marriage and having children, the survey found. While 59% of Trump supporters agreed with this statement, just 19% of President Biden's supporters said the same.  The survey also found sharp differences between voters on the nation's declining birth rate.

(AP Photo/Julia Nikhinson and Evan Vucci)  U.S. births declined across all ethnic and racial groups in 2023, by about 76,000 from the previous year. It was the country's lowest single-year tally of births since 1979, according to The Associated Press.Both Trump and Biden supporters held mixed views on this trend, but Trump supporters were more than twice as likely (47%) than Biden voters (23%) to view this trend as bad for society. Half of Biden voters and about a third of Trump voters held neutral views on the downward birth rate.  Abortion was another issue where Americans had vastly different views.Nearly nine in 10 Biden supporters said abortion should be legal in all or most cases compared to less than four in 10 of Trump supporters who felt the same.

FIRST ON FOX: Outspoken author, actor, Christian and patriot Kirk Cameron is set to hold a new \"See You at the Library\" event this summer on August 24 as a call to stand strong for family, faith and country in a divided America — and as a continuation of what he launched last year with publisher Brave Books, which issues books focused on traditional values.    Cameron spoke to Fox News Digital about his new venture during Pride Month, as activities focused on sexuality and sexual choice occur from coast to coast, he said.\"It is not a surprise to anyone who loves God, who loves their children and who loves America that our country and our children are under assault today,\" said Cameron exclusively this weekend in an on-camera interview. (See the video at the top of this article, as well as other videos within.)  KIRK CAMERON ANNOUNCES ‘INNOVATIVE’ NEW TV SERIES, SAYS AMERICA'S PARENTS ARE ‘SICKENED’ BY WOKE HOLLYWOOD  \"Sometimes, with so much news going on, we can forget all the things that we already know,\" said Cameron, speaking from Charlotte, North Carolina, where he was traveling.   \"I remember very vividly how last year, the administration in Washington, D.C., hoisted a pride flag at the White House in violation of the flag code,\" he said, \"and invited a transgender individual to come to a party at the White House, a person who was not only dressed in a flashy [way] but who was flashing the audience, including children, with their fake breasts on the White House lawn.\"  \"It is not a surprise to anyone who loves God, who loves their children and who loves America that our country and our children are under assault today,\" said author and actor Kirk Cameron to Fox News Digital this weekend. He's holding a new \"See You at the Library\" event this summer on Aug. 24.  (Fox News Digital)And \"this year, as Pride Month is upon us, we're seeing more of an inundation than ever of children [as young as] two and four years old, through television shows like ‘Rachel’ getting over 100 million views and inviting transgender [individual] Dylan Mulvaney on the program. And the Guinness Book of World Records just recorded the largest drag queen story hour in the world, with 268 people.\"   KIRK CAMERON'S NEW BOOK TEACHES KIDS TO LOVE THY ENEMY IN A WORLD TORN BY CONFLICT: ‘GIVE THEM HOPE’Cameron added, \"So many of our children are sadly being influenced to think that pride is a good thing — rather than the very dangerous thing that our previous generations warned about, that the Bible warns about, that our Founding Fathers warned about.\"  And \"even Jordan Peterson is saying, with regard to Pride Month, that you'd better be careful what you call things, because pride is a very dangerous thing … [It can signify] a stubborn refusal to change course when evidence of error is accruing.\"\"We're in the position that we're in now as a nation as a result of the failure of good people to teach their children what is important.\"     Cameron, a husband and father of six grown children, said that too often, Pride Month is \"sadly celebrating the efforts of some to come to terms with the struggles that they have, and for acceptance within the community. And yet we're actually sinking them deeper and deeper down the tunnel that leads to depression, anxiety, suicide and other sorts of things that are hugely on the rise ever since we began to celebrate these vices rather than virtues.\" ‘No time to waste’Cameron said he believes there's a very real urgency to share messages of faith, family and positive values with America's children today.KIRK CAMERON SAYS NEW JERSEY PARENTS ARE FEELING PRESSURE FROM THE LEFT TO TEACH THEIR KIDS ‘WOKE VALUES’    \"There is no time to waste when it comes to teaching our children what's important. I think we're in the position that we're in now as a nation as a result of the failure of good people to teach their children what is important,\" he said. \"And sadly, we've believed the propaganda and the lie that others are better equipped to teach our children what's important, like public schools or even youth pastors at churches.\" VideoHowever, \"when we farm out the sacred task of parenting to other people who are vulnerable to bribery, or to influences that would direct them in ways that are not good for our kids,\" he said, \"we end up paying the consequences. And we're seeing that we're losing a generation of young girls who are mutilating their bodies — boys and girls who are so lost and mixed up in their hearts and in their heads that they don't know who they are. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER  \"They don't know why they're here, they don't know where they're going — and they don't get much help from the adults, because the adults are filled with so much fear of pushing back against the agenda and what they see going on out there, that they're complicit in the problem.\"    Said Cameron, \"And so what do we need? We need courage. We need hope. We need faith. And that's what our movement is endeavoring to instill into the hearts of parents and grandparents so that they can raise their children.\"KIRK CAMERON GREETED BY OVERFLOW NEW YORK LIBRARY CROWD FOR MESSAGE OF FAITH, FAMILY, COUNTRY  Cameron said no one should \"farm out\" their parenting \"to a school or to a church. And I don't want you to farm your parenting out to a movement started by a guy like me. But I want to put tools in your hands,\" he added, \"so that you can do your job as parents and grandparents.\"He said the \"most sacred duty\" of any parent or grandparent \"is to teach your children what is important, to love God with all their hearts, and to care for other people. And that doesn't mean waving a pride flag. Love — the supreme and superlative virtue — has always been opposed to pride,\" he noted.\"Let's teach our children the true meaning of love.\"   \"Love embraces humility. Love speaks out against sin courageously. Love never bows to the crooked and perverse winds of a culture that seeks to enslave your children and take away their future.\"  Cameron said, \"So let's be about love. And let's teach our children the true meaning of love. And that's what our movement and the ‘See You at the Library Day’ is all about this summer.\"‘We need to steel ourselves'Fox News Digital asked Cameron — who first rose to fame on the TV sitcom \"Growing Pains\" — how he remains steadfast and focused on the messages that mean so much to him amid the challenges of doing so, particularly during an election year filled with strife and conflict for many Americans of all walks of life.  Video  \"I am aware of how easy it is to be influenced by bullies,\" Cameron replied. \"I understand that children are up against forces that they are not ready to deal with, and that we need to steel ourselves against enemies of the family, enemies of liberty. And with great courage.\"    And \"I try to learn the lessons from people who have gone before us,\" he said. \"I think of our Founding Fathers and Mothers and all the courageous women and men who sacrificed and demonstrated true love, against all odds, when all hope seemed lost and when they were outnumbered and outgunned by enemies. Somehow, heaven smiled upon them and came to their rescue, and to their aid, and advanced their cause of liberty and faith and hope and love.\"\"That little boy's bravery spread to the entire army. And they were on the attack.\" He said, \"And I think that same heaven can smile down upon us today in the face of the challenges that we have.\"He retold the tale of David and Goliath — and how \"nobody wanted to fight [Goliath] except a little boy named David. We know the story. The stone leaves slingshot, connects with forehead — and the rest is history. And that little boy's bravery spread to the entire army. And they were on the attack.\"  Kirk Cameron speaking during his library events last year, plus — inset — during his interview with Fox News Digital this weekend.   (Brave Books/Fox News/Debbie Wolvos)  It is because \"David understood something his brothers had forgotten,\" Cameron recounted. \"And that was that Goliath was not the giant. There was one standing behind Goliath that David could see that made Goliath look like a midget.

I know the primary way that I'm going to do that is by living out those virtues in my own home, by loving my wife, by embracing the principle of doing unto others as you would have them do unto you, and allow liberty for your neighbors — even if they hold different positions than you do in religion, in politics.\" VideoHe added, \"But when government no longer protects those virtues and plunders those virtues, it is the sacred duty and the right of the citizens of America to correct those errors.

(iStock ) Americans may be missing out on an essential college savings tool, according to a recent survey. Half of all adults saving for education don't know about the benefits of using a 529 savings plan, and less than a quarter of them are using this financial tool to save for college, according to the Edward Jones survey. Additionally, only 25% know that these plans can be used to fund more than just higher education. The biggest obstacle preventing more Americans from using 529 plans is the misconception that they require more savings or income to open. \"A 529 education savings plan is an investment account that offers tax benefits when used toward qualified education expenses for the account beneficiary,\" the survey said. Earnings grow tax-free, and distributions are federally tax-free when used for qualified education expenses. With changes to federal and state laws, 529 plans can now be used for more things.   \"Thanks to tax law changes over the past seven years, 529 plans are more useful and applicable than ever, and can often be used tax-free and penalty-free for secondary schools, technology purchases to further education and much more,\" Andy Esser, an Edward Jones financial advisor said. \"As a financial advisor and parent, I see first-hand the varying benefits of 529 funds – no matter what path a child may choose.

However, only 47% know 529 plans can finance vocational and trade schools. Additionally, 529 savings can be put towards room and board, a considerable expense sometimes not covered by scholarships. Savers can also use these funds to repay student loans. Any unused funds can be rolled over into a Roth IRA for the beneficiary beginning in 2024, according to Edward Jones.  \"Though one-third of Americans saving for a child's education (32%) do not know what a 529 plan is, the features of the savings plan resonate with many,\" the survey said. \"In fact, three out of five Americans (61%) say the tax benefits make them more inclined to enroll in a plan. Other popular features that made Americans more compelled to consider 529 plans include the flexibility to control their 529 accounts (58%) and using the money to pay for qualified education expenses (56%).\"If you hold private student loans, you could lower your monthly payments by refinancing to a lower interest rate.

Inflation slowed more than expected in May, a welcome sign for the Federal Reserve even as prices remained uncomfortably high for millions of Americans. The Labor Department said Wednesday that the consumer price index, a broad measure of how much everyday goods like gasoline, groceries and rent cost, was unchanged in May from the previous month. Prices climbed 3.3% from the same time last year. Both of those figures are lower than the 0.1% monthly increase and 3.4% headline gain forecast by LSEG economists.Another data point that measures underlying inflationary pressures within the economy also moderated last month. So-called core prices, which exclude the more volatile measurements of gasoline and food in order to better assess price growth trends, increased 0.2% in May. From the same time last year, the gauge climbed 3.4% – the lowest reading since 2021. Altogether, the report indicates that inflation is loosening its stranglehold on the U.S. economy, though prices remain well above the Fed's 2% target. RENT PRICES ARE STAGNATING, SUGGESTING HIGH INFLATION MAY STICK AROUND\"After firing hot for the last few years, it appears the inflation engine is starting to cool off,\" said Jason Pride, chief of investment strategy and research at Glenmede. The softer-than-expected report comes just hours before the Fed is scheduled to announce its latest interest-rate decision. Investors anticipate that the Fed will hold rates at a 23-year high, although they will be parsing updated economic quarterly projections and Fed Chair Jerome Powell's post-meeting press conference for clues about where monetary policy is headed this year.Policymakers raised interest rates sharply in 2022 and 2023 to the highest level since the 1980s in a bid to slow the economy and cool inflation. Fed officials are now grappling with when they should take their foot off the brake. Stock futures surged on Wednesday morning and bond yields tumbled as the report fueled hopes that the central bank could cut interest rates as soon as September. POWELL SAYS FED WON'T RUSH TO CUT INTEREST RATES UNTIL INFLATION IS CONQUEREDTicker Security Last Change Change % I:DJI DOW JONES AVERAGES 38953.34 +205.92 +0.53%I:COMP NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX 17675.766357 +332.22 +1.92%SP500 S&P 500 5445.86 +70.54 +1.31% \"We squarely believe today is a no-go meeting and the CPI number was not weak enough to change our view on July’s meeting,\" said Lindsay Rosner, head of multi-sector investing within Goldman Sachs Asset Management. \"While September may be on the table, today would have had to be the first of a handful of inflation data prints that went right, which it did. It does remain challenging, however, for inflation to cool with the backdrop of the summer’s heat.\"High inflation has created severe financial pressures for most U.S. households, which are forced to pay more for everyday necessities like food and rent. Price hikes are particularly devastating for lower-income Americans, because they tend to spend more of their already-stretched paycheck on necessities and therefore have less flexibility to save money.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images / Getty Images)Housing costs were once again the biggest driver of inflation last month, accounting for more than two-thirds of the total monthly increase, according to the report. Rent costs rose 0.4% for the month and are up 5.3% from the same time last year. Rising rents are concerning because higher housing costs most directly and acutely affect household budgets. The increase in rent offset a sharp drop in gas prices, which tumbled 3.6% over the course of May – the first decline since January.GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HEREConsumers also saw a pick-up in food prices, which have been one of the most visceral reminders of inflation for many households. The cost of food rose 0.1% over the course of the month. Although grocery prices were unchanged in May, the price of food away from home jumped 0.4%.\"One main pain point, food prices, did rise a bit but prices of food at grocery stores held steady,\" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at the Navy Federal Credit Union. \"There was relief at the pump, but unfortunately, home and apartment costs continue to rise and remain the main cause of inflation. Until those shelter costs begin their long-awaited fall, we won’t see major drops in CPI.\"\n","Consumers' access to credit grows as appetite for debt soars, a recent TransUnion report said.  (iStock) The high interest rate environment has done little to dampen the appetite for credit products, a recent TransUnion report said.  The report said that in the first quarter of 2024, when counted together, consumers had more than 543 million bank cards in their wallets, an increase of 20 million year over year and more than 88 million from just three years ago. Not only do more Americans have bank cards, but they are also increasingly using their available credit, with balances growing 2.2% over last year. The average new account credit lines rose 3.8% to $5,628.Consumers also increasingly accessed cash through unsecured personal loans. Total unsecured personal loan balances grew 9% to $245 billion in the first quarter of 2024.   The growing appetite for borrowing comes even as the Federal Reserve has maintained interest rates at a two-decade high of 5.25% to 5.5%. High interest rates increase the cost of borrowing.  \"Consumers' access to credit has grown significantly in recent years and will provide them with credit to tap into when needed,\" Michele Raneri, TransUnion vice president of U.S. research and consulting said. \"Many of these consumers are choosing to take advantage of these products that can help them manage their rising monthly household expenses, despite the fact that these products may bring with them interest rates that are higher relative to recent history. \"For these consumers, the short-term pressure of inflation poses a more pressing problem to solve than the potential impact of higher interest rate credit, which includes higher monthly debt service payments,\" Raneri continued.If you are struggling to pay off debt, you could consider using a personal loan to consolidate your payments at a lower interest rate, saving you money each month.

Personal loans, however, have fared better because lenders have shifted to lower-risk borrowers. \"We have seen delinquencies tick up in recent quarters, which is certainly something lenders need to follow closely,\" Raneri said. \"At the same time, the consumer credit market remains resilient given the compounding of relatively high interest rates and persistent inflation. The prevailing hope is that as long as unemployment figures remain relatively low, serious delinquency rates may stabilize.\" Most Americans regret their spending, especially credit card debt, according to the Debt.com survey.  Roughly 78% said they had a financial regret, with 21% saying they most lamented \"charging up too much credit card debt.\" Millennials regret their credit debt the most, and 45% said they feel guilty about \"charging too much on their credit cards.\"Moreover, 49% of the respondents said their regrets about credit card debt are \"always on their mind.\" More than 1 in 4 (26%) of respondents regret running up balances having $15,000 to $30,000 in credit card debt, and 15% owe $30,000 to $50,000. Personal loans can offer consumers lower-interest options to refinance high-cost credit card debt.

The change could have also saved families $10 billion every year. In May, U.S. District Judge Mark T. Pittman, a federal judge in Texas, granted an injunction sought by the banking industry and other business organizations, stating that the rule violated specific federal statutes. The venue for where the lawsuit will be litigated has been moved out of the Texas court twice to Washington, D.C., where it could be more beneficial for the CFPB to defend the rate cap, according to a recent Reuters report. One way to reduce your monthly expenses is to pay off high-interest debt.

(iStock ) Home remodels are gaining in popularity, particularly as prices for existing homes skyrocket. Nearly 63% of homeowners surveyed by Adobe said they’d rather remodel their homes rather than deal with the home-buying process. The survey included more than 1,000 homeowners across the country. The home-buying process can be intimidating, but it doesn’t scare away every buyer. One in three survey respondents would prefer to buy than remodel their current homes. The complexities of remodeling are too stressful for many homeowners.The price was cited in Adobe’s study as the No. 1 reason for not wanting a remodel. Homeowners fear it’s too expensive. Considering that 56% of homeowners who have remodeled their homes exceed their budget, this is a valid fear on the part of homeowners. Other reasons many homeowners want to avoid remodeling include a lack of time to commit to the project and concerns about construction hassles. Being unsure where to start also makes it into the top four reasons homeowners opt to buy instead of remodel.

Creating unique and complex passwords for all your online accounts is not just a kitschy tactic to get you to spring for a password manager. Passwords that are simple can be cracked or guessed by diligent hackers, and if you repeat that password across multiple accounts, then all those accounts are also in jeopardy.   Infuriatingly enough, you can make the concerted effort to create a complex and unique password for all your accounts and even use a password manager, but you will still have your information leaked if the company you are logging onto gets infiltrated. Unfortunately, being notified of having your information compromised in a data breach is more common than not. In addition to having your information unwittingly floating around the dark web to the highest bidder, if your device gets hacked and malware or viruses are installed on it, then your log-ins and passwords can be stolen and sold, too.

Apple held its annual developer’s conference on Monday, announcing new software upgrades for all of its devices.     IOS, which is the operating system that runs on your iPhone, has received what can be considered the biggest upgrade to date. Apple has infused it with artificial intelligence, meaning it is now more capable and feature-rich. IOS 18 is also more customizable than ever, giving you the ability to tweak your home screen and more.   Apple has also announced the macOS 15, iPadOS 18, watchOS 11 and more.  GET SECURITY ALERTS, EXPERT TIPS - SIGN UP FOR KURT’S NEWSLETTER - THE CYBERGUY REPORT HERE  New software upgrades on all Apple devices (Apple)iOS 18: What’s new in the latest software  Apple has officially announced iOS 18. While the software will not be released to the public until September, it does bring some features that every iPhone user should be aware of.The update includes new home screen customization, giving you a theming option for app icons. You can now place app icons anywhere and automatically tint icons with dark mode. You can also swap the new controls onto the lock screen, replacing the flashlight and camera icons.  The list of new iOS 18 features is long, but Apple’s new features for iMessage and texting, in general, are worth noting. The app now lets you respond to messages with any emoji or sticker, not just the old Tapbacks. You can also schedule texts, add effects and format them with underlining, strikethrough and more. Plus, iPhone 14 and 15 users can send messages via satellite even without Wi-Fi or cell service. iOS 18 will also add RCS, reminders integration in Calendar, an option to make your home screen icons bigger, and more.  iOS 18 update (Apple)HOW TO PROTECT YOUR IPHONE AND IPAD FROM MALWARE‘Apple Intelligence’: All about Apple’s AI efforts  Apple has been struggling to maintain its dominance in the smartphone market, losing market share to companies like Samsung and facing significant challenges in important markets like China. However, the company’s latest AI capabilities, collectively called Apple Intelligence, might help it overcome these issues.    Apple Intelligence is a \"personal intelligence\" system that puts generative AI at the heart of the Apple device ecosystem. However, it only works with the latest and greatest Apple devices. To use Apple Intelligence on an iPhone, you need an iPhone 15 Pro or later. On iPads and Macs, you need at least the M1 chip.Apple Intelligence introduces solid improvements to Siri, the virtual assistant on iPhones and iPads. The new Siri has been supercharged with AI, and it understands context, so you don’t have to repeat information. Apple says, \"Siri will be able to find and understand things that it never could before.\" That’s good news for those who noticed that both Alexa and Google Assistant have surpassed Siri’s capabilities for some time.Siri will have on-screen awareness about what you are currently looking at and have the ability to take in-app actions. For instance, if you are filling in a form asking for your driving license number, Siri will automatically be able to find a picture of your driving license and extract the relevant number to fill in the field on your behalf. The Cupertino, California, company has also teamed up with OpenAI to let you use ChatGPT within Siri.    Apple Intelligence also brings new features like Writing Tools, which help you rewrite, proofread and summarize text, and Image Playground, which lets you create images in apps such as Messages and Notes with unique styles like Sketch, Illustration, and Animation.However, these features also encourage you to alter reality and create fake images, made-up rewrites of your own words, and encourage you to read its chosen summaries instead of the whole message sent to you.For example, Apple showed how to create fake AI images of people in your photos and contacts like a birthday photo with a fake version of your friend surrounded by balloons.  Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook, terms Apple Intelligence as \"profound new intelligence capabilities.\" I call Apple Intelligence with ChatGPT a leap forward with significant privacy and security questions. It may be more private than other services, but it is now encouraging less private activity with your personal data.  Apple Intelligence (Apple)    TOP IPHONE CASES OF 2024macOS 15: The Mac software gets upgradedAlongside iOS 18 and iPadOS 18, Apple has also made macOS 15 official. The new software is named after a California landmark: Sequoia. This continues Apple’s tradition, as previous versions were also named after places in California.  The new OS makes it even easier to connect your Mac and iPhone. Now, you can not only mirror your iPhone screen on your Mac but also control your iPhone directly from your Mac. You can even drag and drop between macOS apps and the iPhone screen.Apple has also added a standalone Passwords app in macOS 15 Sequoia, so you can manage your passwords without needing third-party apps. Safari is now smarter, using AI to automatically highlight useful info like map directions or videos on a web page. macOS 15 also gets Apple Intelligence AI features. It can generate text in apps and help you create images.  mMacOS 15 (Apple)  BEST ACCESSORIES FOR YOUR PHONEEverything else Apple announced at WWDC 2024  Apple’s WWDC 2024 was filled with new announcements. While I detailed the major stuff above, here’s everything else the company announced.1. iPadOS 18: It shares many home screen and Control Center configurations with iOS 18. The iPad operating system has also received various enhancements to how iPad apps function, including the addition of a new calculator app, which was previously missing. In the Notes app, the Apple Pencil now offers more powerful handwriting capabilities with the Smart Script feature. If you’re not a fan of your handwriting, you can use this feature to improve its appearance.  2. WatchOS 11: This is the latest operating system for Apple Watches. It offers interactive widgets that provide convenient actions and new watch faces and automatically presents the best photos to \"surprise and delight\" you according to Apple’s marketing spin.

VisionOS 2: Apple also unveiled VisionOS 2, the first major upgrade to its software that runs Apple Vision Pro.

GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE  VisionOS 2 (Apple)Kurt's key takeaway  Apple has made significant changes to its software platforms, which ideally should allow users to get more out of their Apple devices. However, the new AI features being locked to newer devices force consumers to spend more money to buy the latest devices. Apple’s new AI, coming in iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS 15, has some amazingly powerful tools to put the information coming and going in our lives in a more easily usable context. These tools can also be easily misused to spread misinformation and engage in creating fake realities. I appreciate the progress and innovation.

The Bridgeton, New Jersey police department posted a statement on Facebook on Dec. 27 dismissing the article – produced using AI technology – as \"entirely false.\"  NewsBreak doesn’t write all of its articles.

The app has published erroneous stories, created 10 stories from local news sites under fictitious bylines and lifted content from its competitors. Two local community programs assisting disadvantaged people were impacted by erroneous stories produced by NewsBreak's AI.This year, in January, February and March, a Colorado-based food bank, Food to Power, had to turn people away because NewsBreak stated incorrect times for food distributions. The charity complained to NewsBreak in a Jan. 30 email to the company's general customer support address but received no response. Harvest912, a charity in Erie, Pennsylvania, reported a similar incident.

Half of all adults saving for education don't know about the benefits of using a 529 savings plan, and less than a quarter of them are using this financial tool to save for college, according to the Edward Jones survey. Additionally, only 25% know that these plans can be used to fund more than just higher education. The biggest obstacle preventing more Americans from using 529 plans is the misconception that they require more savings or income to open. \"A 529 education savings plan is an investment account that offers tax benefits when used toward qualified education expenses for the account beneficiary,\" the survey said. Earnings grow tax-free, and distributions are federally tax-free when used for qualified education expenses. With changes to federal and state laws, 529 plans can now be used for more things.   \"Thanks to tax law changes over the past seven years, 529 plans are more useful and applicable than ever, and can often be used tax-free and penalty-free for secondary schools, technology purchases to further education and much more,\" Andy Esser, an Edward Jones financial advisor said. \"As a financial advisor and parent, I see first-hand the varying benefits of 529 funds – no matter what path a child may choose.

Savers can also use these funds to repay student loans. Any unused funds can be rolled over into a Roth IRA for the beneficiary beginning in 2024, according to Edward Jones.  \"Though one-third of Americans saving for a child's education (32%) do not know what a 529 plan is, the features of the savings plan resonate with many,\" the survey said. \"In fact, three out of five Americans (61%) say the tax benefits make them more inclined to enroll in a plan. Other popular features that made Americans more compelled to consider 529 plans include the flexibility to control their 529 accounts (58%) and using the money to pay for qualified education expenses (56%).\"If you hold private student loans, you could lower your monthly payments by refinancing to a lower interest rate.

Researchers in Germany have decoded what they say is the oldest-ever manuscript detailing Jesus Christ's life as a child.    The papyrus manuscript dates back more than 1,600 years old to the 4th or 5th century. The document had been stored at a library in Hamburg, Germany, as no one believed the document was of any significance.\"The fragment is of extraordinary interest for research,\" Lajos Berkes, a professor and one of the researchers who decoded the document said in a press release. \"On the one hand, because we were able to date it to the 4th to 5th century, making it the earliest known copy. On the other hand, because we were able to gain new insights into the transmission of the text.\"  \"It was thought to be part of an everyday document, such as a private letter or a shopping list, because the handwriting seems so clumsy,\" he continued. \"We first noticed the word Jesus in the text.

The gospel offers details about Jesus' life as a child before his ministry.The poor handwriting in the document led Berkes to believe the manuscript was made as part of a writing exercise in a monastery or a school.

Pew Research Center released its \"Cultural Issues and the 2024 Election\" report this month, asking 8,709 adults, including 7,166 registered voters, about a wide range of cultural issues including marriage, gender, race, immigration and gun rights.Trump supporters were three times more likely than Biden supporters to say society is better off if people prioritize marriage and having children, the survey found. While 59% of Trump supporters agreed with this statement, just 19% of President Biden's supporters said the same.  The survey also found sharp differences between voters on the nation's declining birth rate.

It was the country's lowest single-year tally of births since 1979, according to The Associated Press.Both Trump and Biden supporters held mixed views on this trend, but Trump supporters were more than twice as likely (47%) than Biden voters (23%) to view this trend as bad for society. Half of Biden voters and about a third of Trump voters held neutral views on the downward birth rate.  Abortion was another issue where Americans had vastly different views.Nearly nine in 10 Biden supporters said abortion should be legal in all or most cases compared to less than four in 10 of Trump supporters who felt the same.

The theft of electric vehicle charging cables is on the rise, possibly fueled by the nearly record-high price of copper. The cables contain copper wiring inside of them that thieves can sell.Cable thefts make it harder for EV manufacturers to convince would-be buyers that a charging station will always be available during their travels, as entire stations are often disabled.Charging companies and police are working on ways to fight back against thieves, like installing more security cameras and visiting recycling centers to look for stolen metal.Just before 2 a.m. on a chilly April night in Seattle, a Chevrolet Silverado pickup stopped at an electric vehicle charging station on the edge of a shopping center parking lot.    Two men, one with a light strapped to his head, got out. A security camera recorded them pulling out bolt cutters. One man snipped several charging cables; the other loaded them into the truck. In under 2½ minutes, they were gone.The scene that night has become part of a troubling pattern across the country: Thieves have been targeting EV charging stations, intent on stealing the cables, which contain copper wiring. The price of copper is near a record high on global markets, which means criminals stand to collect rising sums of cash from selling the material.  AUTO INDUSTRY EXPERTS WARN BIDEN'S EV MANDATE MAY LIMIT GAS CAR OPTIONS IN THE FUTURE  The stolen cables often disable entire stations, forcing EV owners on the road to search desperately for a working charger. For the owners, the predicament can be exasperating and stressful.  Broken-down chargers have emerged as the latest obstacle for U.S. automakers in their strenuous effort to convert more Americans to EVs despite widespread public anxiety about a scarcity of charging stations. About 4 in 10 U.S. adults say they believe EVs take too long to charge or don’t know of any charging stations nearby.If even finding a charging station doesn't necessarily mean finding functioning cables, it becomes one more reason for skeptical buyers to stick with traditional gasoline-fueled or hybrid vehicles, at least for now.  A Tesla supercharging location is seen on Kipling Street on June 3, 2024, in Houston. Charging stations have been hit particularly hard by thieves who likely want to sell the copper wiring inside the cables at near-record prices. (AP Photo/Lekan Oyekanmi)  America's major automakers have made heavy financial bets that buyers will shift away from combustion engines and embrace EVs as they say the world faces the worsening consequences of climate change. Accordingly, the companies have poured billions into EVs.Stellantis envisions 50% of its passenger cars being EVs by the end of 2030. Ford set a target of producing 2 million EVs per year by 2026 — about 45% of its global sales — though it has since suspended that goal. General Motors, the most ambitious of the three, has pledged to sell only EV passenger cars by the end of 2035.  Any such timetables, of course, hinge on whether the companies can convince more would-be EV buyers that a charge will always be available when they travel. The rise in cable thefts isn't likely to strengthen the automakers' case.    Two years ago, according to Electrify America, which runs the nation’s second-largest network of direct-current fast chargers, a cable might be cut perhaps every six months at one of its 968 charging stations, with 4,400 plugs nationwide. Through May this year, the figure reached 129 — four more than in all of 2023. At one Seattle station, cables were cut six times in the past year, said Anthony Lambkin, Electrify America's vice president of operations.\"We’re enabling people to get to work, to take their kids to school, get to medical appointments,\" Lambkin said. \"So to have an entire station that’s offline is pretty impactful to our customers.\"Two other leading EV charging companies — Flo and EVgo — also have reported a rise in thefts. Charging stations in the Seattle area have been a frequent target. Sites in Nevada, California, Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas and Pennsylvania have been hit, too.    Stations run by Tesla, which operates the nation's largest fast-charging network, have been struck in Seattle, Oakland and Houston. So far this year, Seattle police have reported seven cases of cable thefts from charging stations, matching the number for all of 2023. Thieves hit Tesla stations four times this year compared with just once last year, the Seattle police said.\"Vandalism of public charging infrastructure in the Seattle metro area has unfortunately been increasing in frequency,\" EVgo said.The company said law enforcement officials are investigating the thefts while it tries to repair inoperable stations and considers a longer-term solution.  The problem isn't confined to urban areas. In rural Sumner, Washington, about 30 miles south of Seattle, thieves cut cables twice at a Puget Sound Energy charging station. The company is working with police and the property owner to protect the station, which cost more than $500,000 to install.    Until a month ago, police in Houston knew of no cable thefts. Then one was stolen from a charger at a gas station. The city has now recorded eight or nine such thefts, said Sgt. Robert Carson, who leads a police metal-theft unit.In one case, thieves swiped 18 of 19 cords at a Tesla station. That day, Carson visited the station to inspect the damage. In the first five minutes that he was there, Carson said, about 10 EVs that needed charging had to be turned away.  In very large cities like Houston, charging stations typically contain an especially large number of plugs and cables, so thefts can be particularly damaging.\"They're not just taking one,\" Carson said. \"When they're hit, they're hit pretty hard.\"  Roy Manuel, an Uber driver who normally recharges his Tesla at the Houston station hit by thieves, said he fears being unable to do so because of stolen cables.  \"If my battery was really low, I’d have quite an issue with operating my vehicle,\" he said. \"If it was so low that I couldn’t get to another charger, I might be in trouble. Might even need a tow truck.\"The charging companies say it's become clear that the thieves are after the copper that the cables contain. In late May, copper hit a record high of nearly $5.20 a pound, a result, in part, of rising demand resulting from efforts to cut carbon emissions with EVs that use more copper wiring. The price is up about 25% from a year ago, and many analysts envision further increases.  Charging companies say there isn't actually very much copper in the cables, and what copper is there is difficult to extract. Carson estimates that criminals can get $15 to $20 per cable at a scrap yard.    \"They're not making a significant amount of money,\" he said. \"They're not going to be sailing on a yacht anywhere.\"Still, the more cables the thieves can steal, the more they can cash in. At $20 a cable, 20 stolen cables could fetch them $400.The problem for the charging companies is that it's much costlier to replace cables. In Minneapolis, where cables have been clipped at city-owned charging stations, sometimes multiple times, it costs about $1,000 to replace just one cable, said Joe Laurin, project manager in the Department of Public Works.  The charging companies are working on strategies to fight back. Electrify America is installing more security cameras. In Houston, police are visiting recycling centers to look for stolen metal.  But it's often hard for the scrap yards to determine conclusively whether metal came from a charging cable. Thieves often burn off the insulation and just sell strands of metal.The Recycled Materials Association, which represents 1,700 members, is issuing scrap-theft alerts from law enforcement officials so that members can be on the lookout for suspects and stolen goods.    Carson urged EV owners to watch for suspicious people near chargers and to call police.\"If people are driving down the road and you see a gas-powered vehicle, a truck, at a charging station, that probably doesn't belong there,\" he said.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Because charging stations are often situated in remote corners of parking lots, Carson suggested that many more security cameras are needed.In the meantime, Electrify America said Seattle police are trying to track down the thieves in the video. And Carson said the Houston police are pursuing leads in the Tesla theft.\"We'd like to get them stopped,\" he said, \"and then let the court system do what they're supposed to do.\"\n","close      Video 'CyberGuy': Bullet train-looking giant semitruck to hit US highways Kurt Knutsson examines Kenworth’s SuperTruck 2, an aerodynamic tractor-trailer for better efficiency. Kenworth has unveiled its latest innovation, the SuperTruck 2, at the Advanced Clean Transport expo in Las Vegas. This sleek and aerodynamic truck is the result of a six-year collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy aimed at improving freight efficiency without abandoning diesel as the primary energy source.    GET SECURITY ALERTS, EXPERT TIPS - SIGN UP FOR KURT’S NEWSLETTER - THE CYBERGUY REPORT HERE  SuperTruck 2 (Kenworth) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)Pushing the boundaries of efficiencyThe SuperTruck 2 surpassed the company's expectations, achieving a remarkable 136% improvement in efficiency over the 2009 Kenworth T660, which was considered the most fuel-efficient truck at the time. This feat was accomplished through a combination of improved fuel efficiency, reaching up to 12.8 mpg, and a significant weight reduction of over 7,000 pounds.  SuperTruck 2 (Kenworth) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)  KURT’S BEST FATHER’S DAY GIFT GUIDE 2024 Aerodynamic design and weight savings  The aerodynamic design of the SuperTruck 2 is a standout feature, resembling a bullet train with a central cockpit, a narrowed nose, and sloped forehead. The truck also features low skirts, fully enclosed wheels within the bodywork, and slim camera stalks with night vision capabilities, replacing the traditional side mirrors. These design elements contribute to an astonishing 48% reduction in drag.  Weight savings were also a crucial factor, with the SuperTruck 2 tractor and trailer weighing in at 26,100 pounds, representing a 7,100-pound reduction compared to a typical tractor-trailer configuration. Lightweight, low-rolling-resistance tires, a smaller 80-gallon fuel tank, and innovative materials and design considerations all contributed to this significant weight reduction.TESLA SEMI'S IMPRESSIVE PERFORMANCE ON ICE MARKS ANOTHER MAJOR TRIUMPH  SuperTruck 2 (Kenworth) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)  MONSTER PLANE COULD REPLACE TRUCKS AND TRAINSPower train and driver amenitiesThe SuperTruck 2's power train is equally impressive, combining a PACCAR MX-11-based diesel engine, a TX-12 automated transmission, and a 48-volt electric generator to create a mild hybrid system. This system charges lithium-ion batteries through regenerative braking, powering electric fans, steering, coolant, and HVAC systems, which were previously mechanically driven.  In bench testing, this power train achieved a record 55.7% engine efficiency rating, a significant improvement over today's modern diesel engines, which demonstrate around 47% efficiency.    For drivers, the SuperTruck 2 offers a unique experience with a panoramic view from the central cockpit, a configurable 15-inch digital display and a sleeper berth featuring a fold-down bed and a rotating tabletop for added convenience.  SuperTruck 2 (Kenworth) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)A DIY VERSION OF TESLA'S CYBERTRUCK MADE OUT OF WOODFuture-proofing and commercializationWhile the SuperTruck 2 is powered by a diesel engine, Kenworth designed the overall layout to be power train-agnostic, capable of accommodating battery-electric or hydrogen fuel cell-powered drive systems in the future.    Kenworth acknowledges the challenges ahead in achieving a carbon-neutral society by 2050 and views the SuperTruck 2 program as an opportunity to explore and commercialize new technologies more quickly.

The body of a missing skier who appeared to have fallen 200 feet in Mount Rainier National Park in Washington state has been recovered, park officials said on Tuesday.    The skier, a woman whose name was not immediately released, was last heard from on May 18 before she set out for a ski tour above Paradise, the National Park Service (NPS) said. She was reported overdue the following day.The search involved two ground rangers who scoured Deadhorse Creek Basin, Panorama Face, and Alta Vista for tracks in the Nisqually drainage, and two climbing rangers who looked over the Nisqually and Paradise glaciers and searched the Muir Snowfield to Pebble Creek and Panorama Point.

Nothing disrupts a cruise ship vacation like an outbreak of illness — but by taking proper preventative measures, you can help reduce the risk of seafaring sickness.    In the most recent report of cruise ship illness, approximately 25 passengers returning from a cruise started to feel sick with nausea toward the end of a flight last week.\"CDC is aware of a flight from Vancouver, British Columbia, which arrived at Houston’s George Bush Intercontinental Airport on Friday, May 31,\" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in an emailed statement shared with Fox News Digital about United Flight 1528.  CRUISE SHIP'S CONCERNING CONDITIONS EXPOSED AFTER VESSEL FAILS SURPRISE HEALTH INSPECTION  \"Public health officers from CDC’s Houston Port Health Station worked with EMS to evaluate ill passengers on board.\"  Among the 163 passengers on the airplane, 75 were on the same cruise, according to multiple reports.  Nothing disrupts a cruise ship vacation like an outbreak of illness — but taking certain preventative measures can help reduce the risk of seafaring sickness. (iStock)\"As a precautionary measure, the aircraft will be removed from service and go through a deep cleaning before returning to service,\" United Airlines told Fox News Digital in an emailed statement.    Most of the ill passengers reported mild gastrointestinal symptoms, the CDC noted, but none had a fever during the flight or upon physical exams.CONSIDERING A CRUISE? HIGH SEAS MAY BE THE RIGHT OPTION FOR BOTH FAMILY AND WALLET  \"No passengers met CDC criteria for further public health follow-up,\" the CDC stated. \"Passengers from the flight continued with their travel plans.\"    Neither the CDC nor United Airlines specified which cruise line was involved.  The most common illnesses on cruise ships are respiratory illnesses, gastrointestinal infections and other vaccine-preventable diseases, according to the CDC. (iStock)The sick passengers may have taken a cruise on Royal Caribbean International’s Radiance of the Seas, as it was the only ship docked in Vancouver on the day of the flight, according to Cruise Radio, an organization that provides the latest cruise news.The ship had a confirmed norovirus outbreak from April 8 to April 22, according to the CDC.Additional cruise ship outbreaks    The CDC has reported seven outbreaks on cruise ships this year — including the Celebrity Summit by Celebrity Cruises, which sailed from May 24 to May 31.Approximately 68 passengers and five crew members on that ship reported diarrhea and vomiting during the cruise.AIRLINE OUTRAGE: PASSENGER REPORTEDLY TELLS MOM IN FIRST CLASS SHE SHOULDN'T BE THERE WITH A CHILD  Nearly all seven of the outbreaks were linked to norovirus, which historically has caused outbreaks of stomach pains and diarrhea on cruise ships.    The CDC Vessel Sanitation Program generally posts outbreaks that are of \"public health significance.\" This typically includes voyages from the U.S. and foreign ports that are 3-21 days long with 100 or more passengers, with 3% or more of the passengers or crew reporting symptoms of gastrointestinal illness.Common illnesses on cruise ships  The most common illnesses on cruise ships are respiratory illnesses, gastrointestinal infections and other vaccine-preventable diseases, according to the CDC.Among the respiratory illnesses, some common culprits include colds, influenza and COVID-19.\"Ships have close living quarters and communal spaces, which allow bacteria and viruses to spread more easily.\"   Gastrointestinal illnesses are highly contagious, the CDC warned.  Those can be caused by various germs, including bacteria, viruses or parasites, with the norovirus particularly well-known for causing stomach illness on ships.Norovirus, often referred to as the stomach flu, usually causes symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and stomach pain within 12 to 48 hours of exposure.  NOROVIRUS SPREAD ON THE WASHINGTON PACIFIC CREST TRAIL — WHAT TO KNOW AND HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF    Some people may also experience headaches, body aches and fever.People generally get better within several days, but they can still spread the infection several days after they feel well, according to the CDC.Why are cruise ships susceptible to outbreaks?\"Ships have close living quarters and communal spaces, which allow bacteria and viruses to spread more easily,\" Jill Blumenthal, M.D., infectious disease specialist at UC San Diego Health, told Fox News Digital.  \"In addition, passengers are regularly joining [the cruise] at different stops, making it easier to introduce illness.\"  Norovirus, often called the stomach flu, usually causes symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and stomach pain within 12-48 hours of exposure. (iStock)  Cruises may bring passengers to locations that put them at increased risk of infectious diseases like malaria, yellow fever, dengue fever, Zika, chikungunya and Lyme disease due to exposure to mosquito or tick bites, the CDC warned. Travelers are also more susceptible to food-borne illnesses, which can easily be transmitted person-to-person on a cruise ship.    DRINKING ALCOHOL BEFORE SLEEPING ON A PLANE COULD BE DANGEROUS, STUDY SUGGESTS\"Food-handling practices and water systems aboard certain vessels may have the potential for transmission of foodborne and waterborne diseases,\" Blumenthal said.  \"Port visits can also expose travelers to local diseases, which they can bring back on board,\" the doctor warned.Passengers should consult a health care provider to discuss risks.   Approximately 12.5 million passengers traveled on cruises that began in North American ports in 2022, per the CDC. Tips to prevent sickness on a cruiseThe CDC recommends that people ask about COVID-19 testing or vaccination protocols before traveling — and to consider wearing a mask in crowded or poorly ventilated areas.Prior to taking a cruise, passengers should consult a health care provider to discuss risks, vaccinations and other prevention strategies, as well as any medications to help prevent illness, said Blumenthal.   People should always remember to wash their hands with soap and water after using the bathroom, eating or touching surfaces, experts advised. (iStock)    This is particularly important for those who have chronic health conditions or who are immunocompromised, elderly or pregnant, the doctor said.  People should always remember to wash their hands with soap and water after using the bathroom, eating or touching surfaces.Alcohol-based sanitizers are not effective against the virus, experts warn.

Some people are prone to seasickness or motion sickness, including those who are taking certain medications, such as birth control pills, antidepressants or painkillers, the CDC noted on its website.

Salads are commonly hailed as the epitome of healthy eating — thought to be low in calories, low-carb and nutrient-dense.     \"Some sneaky culprits, however, can turn your healthy meal into a calorie-laden dish,\" said Nikki Kuhlmann, RD, LDN, a registered dietitian with Anne Till Nutrition Group in Raleigh, North Carolina.To find out more about how calories may be hiding and adding up in your leafy salad greens, three registered dietitians weighed in on what the culprits are and why they pose a problem.  DELICIOUS (AND EASY) BRUSSELS SPROUTS RECIPE COULD ROCK YOUR WORLD   They also shared suggestions for healthier alternatives.   Here are six areas worth watching.  1. Salad dressingsYou may believe that choosing a salad for lunch and dinner almost guarantees a low-calorie and healthy meal choice, but the wrong salad dressing can shift your meal to one with more calories than expected.   Stay clear of creamy dressings, said Julie Lopez, RD, with Virtual Teaching Kitchen Succasunna, New Jersey.   You may have prepared an amazingly healthy and delicious salad — but the wrong dressing could shift your meal to one with unexpected calories. Here's what to know — and to make the wisest choices.  (iStock)Even too much dressing can be a sneaky trap, too.   \"You can always add more dressing, but you can’t take it away,\" she said.    \"Some [people] recommend dipping your fork in the dressing, but I personally like to toss it all together. So I like to add a little and toss it so it lightly coats it.\"\"A healthier way to go is to make your own dressing using olive oil, vinegar or lemon juice, and a touch of mustard or honey for flavor.\" Also, store-bought dressings are loaded with sugar, unhealthy fats and preservatives, warned Kuhlmann with Anne Till Nutrition Group. Even \"light\" or \"fat-free\" versions can be high in sugars and additives to compensate for the lack of fat, she said.     STRAWBERRY SALMON SALAD: A REFRESHING RECIPE FOR SPRINGTIME WHILE BERRIES ARE RIPE AND IN SEASON\"A healthier way to go is to make your own dressing using olive oil, vinegar or lemon juice, and a touch of mustard or honey for flavor,\" Kuhlmann told Fox News Digital. \"This way, you control the ingredients and the portion size.\"2. Cheese toppings   While cheese adds flavor and texture, food pros say it’s high in calories and saturated fats.     \"A small sprinkle can quickly escalate the calorie count,\" Kuhlmann said. \"Cheese can add 100-200 calories per serving and significant amounts of saturated fat, which can contribute to heart disease if consumed in excess.\"   This fresh Caesar salad has romaine lettuce hearts, croutons, Parmesan cheese and dressing. If you want cheese in your salad, use a small amount of strong-flavored cheese like feta or Parmesan, one expert suggested.

Croutons and other crunchy toss-insCroutons, bacon bits and fried onions add crunch but also a hefty dose of calories, unhealthy fats and sometimes sugars, Kuhlmann said.   \"These toppings can add 100-150 calories per serving and are often made with refined grains and unhealthy oils,\" she said.   THESE 6 POWER FOODS CAN PREVENT CANCER, ACCORDING TO VARIOUS HEALTH EXPERTSA healthier idea is to instead use nuts or seeds like almonds, walnuts or sunflower seeds, she noted.  \"These provide healthy fats, protein, and a satisfying crunch and toasting them can enhance their flavor,\" she added. 4. Protein picks    True, protein is essential, but some choices like fried chicken, processed deli meats or large amounts of steak can significantly increase calories and unhealthy fats, explained Kuhlmann. Consider grilled or baked chicken or fish, tofu, beans or legumes.  \"These protein sources can add anywhere from 200-400 extra calories, plus unhealthy fats and sodium,\" she pointed out. FRUITS AND VEGETABLES RIPE IN SPRING AND HOW YOU CAN INCORPORATE THEM INTO YUMMY SEASONAL DISHES   Instead, consider grilled or baked chicken or fish, tofu, beans or legumes.   These options are lower in unhealthy fats and can provide high-quality protein.5. Pasta and grainsSalads with added pasta, quinoa or couscous make them more filling — but these can also be calorie-dense.   Instead of pasta, quinoa or other salad add-ons, try cauliflower rice or spiralized vegetables like zucchini noodles for a lower-calorie alternative.  (Sezgin Pancar/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)    \"A cup of pasta or grains can add 200-300 calories,\" said Kuhlmann. \"While these can be healthy carbs, they can also push your salad into a high-calorie meal if not portioned properly.\"If you want to add grains, keep the portion small — about a quarter cup.   'MARRY ME TORTELLINI' RECIPE FOR A ROMANTIC DINNER AT HOME  \"You can also use cauliflower rice or spiralized vegetables like zucchini noodles for a lower-calorie alternative,\" she suggested. 6. Dried fruitCommon salad toppers can include dried fruits like raisins, cranberries, dates and cherries — but these sweet add-ins can boost your calorie intake. \"I love dried fruit, but throwing a big handful on a salad can add quite a few calories,\" said Lisa Valente, MS, RD, food expert with Healthline, who is based in Burlington, Vermont.   \"If you’re really craving dried fruit, be mindful of portion size and look for no added sugar options.\" (iStock)    \"I prefer using fresh fruit for a little bit of sweetness … You get a much bigger portion, but if you’re really craving dried fruit, be mindful of portion size and look for no added sugar options.\"7. Nuts and seeds    Nuts and seeds can add crunch, are sources of healthy fats and can help you feel fuller between meals — but keep portion size in check. ​​FOR A BETTER NIGHT'S SLEEP, TRY EATING MORE OF THESE FOODS, RESEARCHERS SAY  \"Choose smaller nuts and seeds, like slivered almonds or sunflower seeds, to help spread them out over your salad without going for a huge portion,\" suggested Valente with Healthline.   And when picking nuts, skip the candied nut varieties, said Lopez with Virtual Testing Kitchen.Must-have ingredients for a healthy saladTo make your salad both bountiful and healthy, here are some tips to keep you on a healthy track.

After a much-needed break in the severe storms, a pair of severe weather days looks in store for the Midwest.CHICAGO – Severe storms are set to rumble across the Plains and Midwest as a new disturbance rolls out of the Northwest starting Wednesday.  The initial round of severe storms will fire across the Upper Midwest on Wednesday afternoon. The stronger storms could become supercells capable of large hail greater than 3 inches in diameter, damaging wind gusts up to 65 mph and a couple of tornadoes.Rounds of thunderstorms are expected Wednesday and then again Thursday across the Midwest ahead of a strong cold front sliding through the region.(FOX Weather) By early evening, low-level wind shear – the change in wind speed and direction with height – will intensify, which will increase the chance of a few tornadoes across northern Minnesota and Wisconsin. A wind-damage threat will also be possible. This includes the Duluth area. The FOX Forecast Center noted there have not been any tornadoes recorded in northeastern Minnesota in two years.  \"Notice we do have a Level 3 out of 5 threat for severe storms,\" FOX Weather Meteorologist Kendall Smith said. \"This is centered right over kind of northern Minnesota.\"More than a half-million people are impacted by this Level 3 risk, including in cities such as Duluth, Hibbing, Brainerd and Cloquet in Minnesota, in addition to Superior, Wisconsin.Wedneday's activity will be more scattered with the strongest storms capable of very large hail to 3 inches in diameter, damaging wind gusts to 65 mph and a couple of tornadoes.(FOX Weather) The severe weather threat should continue into the mid- to late evening as storms move eastward into the far western Great Lakes region.More severe storms to fire up ThursdaySevere storms will fire up again on Thursday from the central Plains to the Great Lakes ahead of a cold front sweeping through the region. Cities such as Chicago and Kansas City are in the greatest threat area.The National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center has issued a Level 2 out of 5 on the severe storm risk scale impacting nearly 16 million people in other major cities including Aurora, Illinois, and Overland Park, Kansas.\"Today's (Wednesday's) coverage is more sparse, tomorrow's (Thursday's) coverage more widespread, but coverage is more of a strong, damaging wind event,\" Smith said.Thursday will feature a line of storms that will develop directly along the cold front with cities such as Chicago and Kansas City in the greatest threat area.(FOX Weather) While severe storms could develop along a 1,000-mile stretch from eastern Colorado and Wyoming into Michigan, the greatest potential for severe storms appears to be from northeastern Kansas northeastward into southern Michigan, where the greatest atmospheric energy will develop. While supercells with large hail are possible, it appears clusters of storms and their associated damaging wind gusts will be the main threat. A tornado or two cannot be ruled out either.\n","close      Video Biden admin can’t ‘force’ electric vehicle goals: Robert Wolf Former Obama economic adviser Robert Wolf and Solus Alternative Asset Management’s Dan Greenhaus discuss the Biden administration’s electric vehicle push despite low demand.

The theft of electric vehicle charging cables is on the rise, possibly fueled by the nearly record-high price of copper. The cables contain copper wiring inside of them that thieves can sell.Cable thefts make it harder for EV manufacturers to convince would-be buyers that a charging station will always be available during their travels, as entire stations are often disabled.Charging companies and police are working on ways to fight back against thieves, like installing more security cameras and visiting recycling centers to look for stolen metal.Just before 2 a.m. on a chilly April night in Seattle, a Chevrolet Silverado pickup stopped at an electric vehicle charging station on the edge of a shopping center parking lot.    Two men, one with a light strapped to his head, got out. A security camera recorded them pulling out bolt cutters. One man snipped several charging cables; the other loaded them into the truck. In under 2½ minutes, they were gone.The scene that night has become part of a troubling pattern across the country: Thieves have been targeting EV charging stations, intent on stealing the cables, which contain copper wiring. The price of copper is near a record high on global markets, which means criminals stand to collect rising sums of cash from selling the material.  AUTO INDUSTRY EXPERTS WARN BIDEN'S EV MANDATE MAY LIMIT GAS CAR OPTIONS IN THE FUTURE  The stolen cables often disable entire stations, forcing EV owners on the road to search desperately for a working charger. For the owners, the predicament can be exasperating and stressful.  Broken-down chargers have emerged as the latest obstacle for U.S. automakers in their strenuous effort to convert more Americans to EVs despite widespread public anxiety about a scarcity of charging stations. About 4 in 10 U.S. adults say they believe EVs take too long to charge or don’t know of any charging stations nearby.If even finding a charging station doesn't necessarily mean finding functioning cables, it becomes one more reason for skeptical buyers to stick with traditional gasoline-fueled or hybrid vehicles, at least for now.  A Tesla supercharging location is seen on Kipling Street on June 3, 2024, in Houston. Charging stations have been hit particularly hard by thieves who likely want to sell the copper wiring inside the cables at near-record prices. (AP Photo/Lekan Oyekanmi)  America's major automakers have made heavy financial bets that buyers will shift away from combustion engines and embrace EVs as they say the world faces the worsening consequences of climate change. Accordingly, the companies have poured billions into EVs.Stellantis envisions 50% of its passenger cars being EVs by the end of 2030. Ford set a target of producing 2 million EVs per year by 2026 — about 45% of its global sales — though it has since suspended that goal. General Motors, the most ambitious of the three, has pledged to sell only EV passenger cars by the end of 2035.  Any such timetables, of course, hinge on whether the companies can convince more would-be EV buyers that a charge will always be available when they travel. The rise in cable thefts isn't likely to strengthen the automakers' case.    Two years ago, according to Electrify America, which runs the nation’s second-largest network of direct-current fast chargers, a cable might be cut perhaps every six months at one of its 968 charging stations, with 4,400 plugs nationwide. Through May this year, the figure reached 129 — four more than in all of 2023. At one Seattle station, cables were cut six times in the past year, said Anthony Lambkin, Electrify America's vice president of operations.\"We’re enabling people to get to work, to take their kids to school, get to medical appointments,\" Lambkin said. \"So to have an entire station that’s offline is pretty impactful to our customers.\"Two other leading EV charging companies — Flo and EVgo — also have reported a rise in thefts. Charging stations in the Seattle area have been a frequent target. Sites in Nevada, California, Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas and Pennsylvania have been hit, too.    Stations run by Tesla, which operates the nation's largest fast-charging network, have been struck in Seattle, Oakland and Houston. So far this year, Seattle police have reported seven cases of cable thefts from charging stations, matching the number for all of 2023. Thieves hit Tesla stations four times this year compared with just once last year, the Seattle police said.\"Vandalism of public charging infrastructure in the Seattle metro area has unfortunately been increasing in frequency,\" EVgo said.The company said law enforcement officials are investigating the thefts while it tries to repair inoperable stations and considers a longer-term solution.  The problem isn't confined to urban areas. In rural Sumner, Washington, about 30 miles south of Seattle, thieves cut cables twice at a Puget Sound Energy charging station. The company is working with police and the property owner to protect the station, which cost more than $500,000 to install.    Until a month ago, police in Houston knew of no cable thefts. Then one was stolen from a charger at a gas station. The city has now recorded eight or nine such thefts, said Sgt. Robert Carson, who leads a police metal-theft unit.In one case, thieves swiped 18 of 19 cords at a Tesla station. That day, Carson visited the station to inspect the damage. In the first five minutes that he was there, Carson said, about 10 EVs that needed charging had to be turned away.  In very large cities like Houston, charging stations typically contain an especially large number of plugs and cables, so thefts can be particularly damaging.\"They're not just taking one,\" Carson said. \"When they're hit, they're hit pretty hard.\"  Roy Manuel, an Uber driver who normally recharges his Tesla at the Houston station hit by thieves, said he fears being unable to do so because of stolen cables.  \"If my battery was really low, I’d have quite an issue with operating my vehicle,\" he said. \"If it was so low that I couldn’t get to another charger, I might be in trouble. Might even need a tow truck.\"The charging companies say it's become clear that the thieves are after the copper that the cables contain. In late May, copper hit a record high of nearly $5.20 a pound, a result, in part, of rising demand resulting from efforts to cut carbon emissions with EVs that use more copper wiring. The price is up about 25% from a year ago, and many analysts envision further increases.  Charging companies say there isn't actually very much copper in the cables, and what copper is there is difficult to extract. Carson estimates that criminals can get $15 to $20 per cable at a scrap yard.    \"They're not making a significant amount of money,\" he said. \"They're not going to be sailing on a yacht anywhere.\"Still, the more cables the thieves can steal, the more they can cash in. At $20 a cable, 20 stolen cables could fetch them $400.The problem for the charging companies is that it's much costlier to replace cables. In Minneapolis, where cables have been clipped at city-owned charging stations, sometimes multiple times, it costs about $1,000 to replace just one cable, said Joe Laurin, project manager in the Department of Public Works.  The charging companies are working on strategies to fight back. Electrify America is installing more security cameras. In Houston, police are visiting recycling centers to look for stolen metal.  But it's often hard for the scrap yards to determine conclusively whether metal came from a charging cable. Thieves often burn off the insulation and just sell strands of metal.The Recycled Materials Association, which represents 1,700 members, is issuing scrap-theft alerts from law enforcement officials so that members can be on the lookout for suspects and stolen goods.    Carson urged EV owners to watch for suspicious people near chargers and to call police.\"If people are driving down the road and you see a gas-powered vehicle, a truck, at a charging station, that probably doesn't belong there,\" he said.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Because charging stations are often situated in remote corners of parking lots, Carson suggested that many more security cameras are needed.In the meantime, Electrify America said Seattle police are trying to track down the thieves in the video. And Carson said the Houston police are pursuing leads in the Tesla theft.\"We'd like to get them stopped,\" he said, \"and then let the court system do what they're supposed to do.\"\n","close      Video NTSB drone footage shows aftermath of Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse The NTSB released drone footage of the now collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore and the container ship that crashed into a piling causing the structure to fall. Authorities say commercial shipping traffic through the Port of Baltimore will soon return to normal levels since the waterway fully reopened earlier this week for the first time since the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse.Officials estimate the salvage operations will cost up to $75 million, and rebuilding the bridge could cost nearly $2 billion.The exact causes of the electrical issues that caused the cargo ship Dali to lose power and crash into the bridge have yet to be determined.Authorities anticipate commercial shipping traffic through the Port of Baltimore will soon return to normal levels since the channel fully reopened earlier this week for the first time since the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse.    \"They are back open for business, ready to bring in the largest container ships that call there,\" U.S. Coast Guard Rear Admiral Shannon Gilreath said during a virtual press briefing Tuesday afternoon.Some shipping companies rerouted their cargo to other ports following the deadly bridge collapse in March. The disaster halted most maritime traffic through Baltimore’s busy port as crews worked around the clock to clear an estimated 50,000 tons of fallen steel and concrete from the Patapsco River — a roughly $100 million effort that involved federal, state and local agencies, officials said.  COAST GUARD STUDYING IF OTHER BRIDGES AT RISK FOLLOWING BALTIMORE BRIDGE DISASTER  Companies that steered clear of Baltimore during the cleanup efforts will likely come back now that the channel has been returned to its original depth and width, officials said. The city’s port processes more cars and farm equipment than any other in the country.  All that rerouted commercial traffic \"belongs in Baltimore today,\" U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said. \"We have every indication that that is what is taking place, but we will be reinforcing that expectation as we speak with players up and down the supply chains.\"Crews were able to reopen portions of the deep-draft channel in phases, restoring some commercial traffic in recent weeks. Some cruise ships and large container ships have already passed through, officials said.  Salvage crews continue to clean up wreckage from the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in the Patapsco River on June 11, 2024, in Baltimore, Maryland. Baltimore's Fort McHenry Federal Channel has fully opened for shipping traffic months after the cargo ship Dali collided with the bridge, causing it to collapse. (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)  But thousands of longshoremen, truckers and small business owners have seen their jobs impacted by the collapse and its economic ripple effects, which extend well beyond the Baltimore region.Officials estimated the salvage operations will cost up to $75 million, while the Coast Guard response has cost $24 million to date.  Rebuilding the bridge could cost nearly $2 billion, officials have said. They hope it’s completed by 2028.    The Biden administration approved $60 million in immediate federal aid, which Buttigieg referred to as \"a down payment on the work ahead.\" All of that aid has been committed, said White House Deputy Chief of Staff Natalie Quillian.President Joe Biden has pledged that the federal government will cover the full cost of rebuilding the bridge, though officials said the funding is still awaiting approval from Congress.In a statement Tuesday, Biden praised the work of everyone involved in the recovery effort to date.    \"Baltimore can count on us to stick with them every step of the way, and we will continue to have your back until the bridge is rebuilt,\" he said.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe cargo ship Dali crashed into a critical support column of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in the early hours of March 26, collapsing the span and sending six members of a roadwork crew plunging to their deaths. The ship had lost power shortly after leaving Baltimore for Sri Lanka. A National Transportation Safety Board investigation found it experienced power outages before starting its voyage, but the exact causes of the electrical issues have yet to be determined. The FBI is also conducting a criminal investigation into the circumstances leading up to the collapse.  The Dali remained stuck amid the wreckage for almost two months, with a massive steel truss draped across its damaged bow. On May 20, the ship was refloated and guided back to port. That allowed officials to open a channel that was 50 feet deep and 400 feet wide, big enough for most of the largest commercial vessels.    The full federal shipping channel is 700 feet wide. Officials said two-way traffic can resume now that it has reopened. They said additional safety requirements have also been lifted because of the increased width.\n","close      Video Video shows suspected arsonist sets himself on fire Neighbor's surveillance camera captures moment a wannabe arsonist sets self on fire while trying to burn down ex-girlfriend's home.

Empowered by a stunning triumph at the European elections, France’s far-right National Rally on Tuesday hit the national campaign trail with its star leader, Jordan Bardella, promising supporters \"the largest possible majority\" at the upcoming parliamentary vote.    Opposition parties on the left and right have been scrambling to form alliances and field candidates in the snap national elections called by President Emmanuel Macron after his party suffered a crushing defeat by the far right in the European Parliament vote on Sunday.A win for the National Rally in the national elections could result in the French far right leading a government for the first time since World War II.  EUROPEAN VOTERS REJECT SOCIALISM, FAR-LEFT POLICIES IN EU PARLIAMENT ELECTIONS: 'POLITICAL EARTHQUAKE'  While sharp differences between parties remain on either side of the political spectrum, prominent figures calling for a united front appear to have one thing in common: They don’t want to cooperate with Macron.  Despite their divisions, left-wing parties agreed late Monday to form an alliance that includes the Greens, the Socialists, the Communists and the far-left France Unbowed of Jean-Luc Mélenchon. Leaders have not agreed on who will head the coalition nor on its program.In light of the European polls, politicians on the left are focused on closing ranks to prevent a win for the National Rally. For now, they have also vowed not to join forces with Macron's centrists.  In a joint statement, the alliance called on all forces on the left, including the influential labor unions, to unite behind a \"new popular front\" to form an \"alternative to Emmanuel Macron and to fight against the racist project of the far right.\"  French far-right leader Marine Le Pen delivers a speech as Jordan Bardella, president of the French far-right National Rally, listens at the party election night headquarters after French President Emmanuel Macron announced he dissolved the National Assembly and calls new legislative election after defeat in EU vote, Sunday, June 9, 2024 in Paris. First projected results from France put far-right National Rally party well ahead in EU elections, according to French opinion poll institutes. (AP Photo/Lewis Joly)National Rally leader Marine Le Pen is working to consolidate power on the right ahead of the two-round elections on June 30 and July 7. Le Pen’s niece, Marion Maréchal, who won a seat in the European Parliament on Sunday as a member of the rival Reconquer! party of Éric Zemmour, on Monday visited National Rally headquarters in Paris to negotiate a far-right alliance.  Family ties aside, Maréchal said Tuesday that Bardella informed her of a change of heart in the National Rally regarding a pact with the Reconquer! party. Bardella offered \"a regrettable explanation against an agreement by saying that (Le Pen's party) does not want to be associated directly or indirectly with Éric Zemmour,\" Maréchal said in a statement.    Le Pen also met with members of the conservative Republicans party to discuss a united front. Some conservative lawmakers have supported some of Macron’s bills in the National Assembly since the president lost a majority in the lower house of the French parliament following the 2022 general election.\"We have a historic chance to allow the national camp to put France back on track,\" Le Pen said in an interview with the French public broadcaster on Monday evening. She said the National Rally and the conservatives could agree on several policy goals, including an economic recovery plan, boosting purchasing power and curbing immigration.The Republicans' President Éric Ciotti said he wants an agreement with Le Pen, prompting several prominent members of his party to call for his resignation. Ciotti insisted the conservatives need the alliance for their political survival.    \"I want my political family to move in this direction,\" he said in an interview with the French public broadcaster on Tuesday. He blasted what he said was Macron’s bloc within the conservative party, \"which has led the country to where it is today — with more violence, more insecurity.\"\"A right-wing bloc, a national bloc … is what the vast majority of our voters want,\" Ciotti said.Bardella, Le Pen’s 28-year-old protégé and the face of the far right's European triumph, also urged French conservatives to ride the wave of popularity with the National Rally. He urged the conservatives to \"stop being Emmanuel Macron’s political crutch\" and \"come and work alongside us.\"  French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire called on Macron's Renaissance party members to \"make room\" in their ranks for those conservatives who refuse to cooperate with the far right at the election.    Earlier Tuesday, Prime Minister Gabriel Attal met with the outgoing Renaissance lawmakers still reeling from their defeat by the far right and the president’s decision to dissolve the National Assembly.Attal acknowledged that the dissolution was \"a brutal decision\" for the lawmakers, but he urged them to prepare for \"the new fight.\"  \"You embody stability against chaos … courage
